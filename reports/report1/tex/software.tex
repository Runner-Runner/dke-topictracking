\subsection{LDA Implementation by Blei}

Among the various implementations provided by David Blei and his group at Columbia University there is also a ready-to-use application\footnote{https://github.com/Blei-Lab/dtm} corresponding to the dynamic model described in \cite{Blei:2006:DTM:1143844.1143859}. Unfortunately there is no implementation for the continuous extension. Another backdraw is that the documentation is very sparse and the implementation is in C as most of the original work.
