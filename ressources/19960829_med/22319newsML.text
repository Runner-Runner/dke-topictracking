The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it temporarily added reserves to the banking system on Thursday via six-day fixed system repurchase agreements. The Fed is facing a huge daily add need estimated at between $6.5 billion and $8 billion around the Labor Day holiday on Monday. It may supplement today's operation with four-day fixed system RPs on Friday, analysts said. Such operation is likely to be conducted around 1000 EDT/1400 GMT due to a shortened session in the Treasury market which will close Friday at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, they said.
