U.S. crude oil stocks were seen bursting at the seams with imports posing a clear danger to markets bracing for some cutbacks due to upcoming fall refinery turnarounds, traders said on Thursday. About 40 percent of loadings out of Sullom Voe last week were destined for the U.S., with shipments also being fixed out of the Mediterranean and the Far East. Traders said there was evidence BP had chartered a large ship from Asia carrying Indonesian crudes for the U.S. Gulf. "BP's bringing in a ship with Attaka, Udang and Minas for late September or early October," a Gulf Coast trader said.   Traders estimated the shipment was around two million barrels and supply would be retained for BP's own system. BP declined comment on details about the cargo. Saturated West Coast markets, with half of last week's 10.4 million barrel build mostly concentrated in PADD 5, was blamed for filtering cargoes to the Gulf Coast. Heavier Asian Duri crude and low sulphur waxy residue were thought likely to poke into the U.S. Gulf as well, amid strong competition from Canadian crudes on the West Coast.   Iranian crude exports challenging Urals and displacing Mediterranean demand also pushed two shipments into the U.S. and Caribbean last week, traders said. Meanwhile, the arbitrage for light, sweet crudes drew a one million barrel cargo sale of Troll for mid October at Oct WTI minus 25 cents, including lightering costs, Wednesday. The cargo was split between two U.S. refiners. Brent and Oseberg for early October are currently offered at about 10 cents discount to WTI cif. --Jacqueline Wong, New York Energy Desk +1 212 859 1620
