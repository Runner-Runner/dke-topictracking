--------------------------- Aug 29 ------------------------- * Central Bank injects more volatility ------------------------------------------------------------ The Central Bank's withdrawal of its reverse repos pushed the Philippine peso down on Thursday to close at 26.201 to the dollar from 26.196, traders said. "The initial reaction was for banks to drop the peso and go for dollar-denominated investments," said a trader. The day's average was 26.202 versus 26.194. Volume swelled to $191.60 million from $143.50 million.   The withdrawal of the reverse repos left banks with limited investment choices, which would tend to drive interest rates lower and make the peso less attractive to hold, traders said. Downward pressure also came when the Central Bank bought $8 million at 26.199 in early trade from a previous 26.195. "The Central bank wanted to stir the market to increase the demand for dollars," a trader said, adding that the Central Bank's twin actions injected some volatility in the market. The Central Bank purchased an additional $19 million at 26.198 in late trading, traders said.-LILIAN KARUNUNGAN (632) 841-8937
