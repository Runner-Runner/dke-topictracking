The Brazilian government expects to accept tenders for Band B cellular telephone services in December, with concession winners expected to start operations by the end of 1997, a local news agency reported. The private Invest News agency, quoting the Ministry of Communications' secretary for communication services, Mario Leonel Netto, said regulations for the services were expected to be published next month. In the second week of October, the ministry foresaw the publication of concession models, with tender details emerging in November, Invest News said.   Netto said winners of concessions were likely to be informed during the first quarter of 1997. He also confirmed that the government wished to privatize the state's long distance and international carrier, Embratel, which is part of the Telebras system. Netto was addressing a seminar in the city of Rio das Pedras in Sao Paulo state, Invest News said. -- Michael Christie, Brasilia newsroom 55-61-2230358
