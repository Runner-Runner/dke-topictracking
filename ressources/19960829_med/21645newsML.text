Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said on Thursday it would conduct some of its pilot training at Zhuhai airport in southern China. "The reason we will use Zhuhai airport is because (Hong Kong's) Kai Tak (airport) does not have the time slots for landing and take-off training for our pilots," said a spokesman for the Hong Kong-based carrier. Zhuhai is located just over the border from Portuguese-run Macau, some 60 km across the Pearl River delta from Hong Kong. Cathay already trains pilots in Bangkok airport and at Shenzhen airport, just over the Hong Kong-China border. Bangkok will be used less frequently, the spokesman said, but declined to elaborate. Asked whether training in Zhuhai would save money, the spokesman said cost was not a a key concern in this case. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6441
