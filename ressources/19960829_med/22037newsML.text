Pakistani rice export prices seem set on a downward path that may get steeper when the new crop arrives from mid-September, dealers said on Thursday. IRRI-6 prices dropped to $270 per tonne FOB this week from $290 on August 22, in step with lower world prices, an official at the state Rice Export Corporation of Pakistan (RECP) said. One exporter said rates fell after Sri Lanka obtained lower prices in tenders for the import of 30,000 tonnes of rice in three equal deliveries in October, November and December. Basmati prices fell to $435 per tonne FOB from $515 last week after the RECP sold 10,000 tonnes to a local dealer for export at $433.75 per tonne, the exporter said. Pakistani rice exports fell 26.21 percent to 1.366 million worth $450 million in 1995/96 (July-June) from 1.852 million worth $454 million in 1994/95. The exporter attributed the drop in official exports to the smuggling of several hundred thousand tonnes of rice to neighbouring Iran and Afghanistan.
