Italian bond futures held to higher levels by late afternoon helped by the recovery in the lira and managed to avoid losses on Treasuries after a strong upward revision to U.S. Q2 GDP data, dealers said. The market had started lower after the easier overnight tone to T-bonds and an earlier weak lira, but as the currency recovered against the German mark, futures began to outperform many other world bonds in a day of moderate trading volumes. "The market managed to weather the GDP data and the jump in home sales and show some surprising resilience," said one dealer on London's LIFFE market.   After the upward revision to U.S. Q2 GDP data, fresh U.S. data showed July home sales jumped 7.9 percent and this second sign of good U.S. growth pushed T-bond further lower. Dealers added that BTP were supported by good demand at today's Italian auction of Treasury paper, which included 1.5 trillion lire of 10-year BTPs and seven trillion lire of seven-year CCT variable rate certificates. Italy wage inflation declined to 3.9 percent in July from 4.1 percent in June on an annual basis, but most attention in this wage inflation area is focused on the next round of wage settlements this autumn. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129502
