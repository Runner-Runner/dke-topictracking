U.S. municipal bond prices exited Thursday's sleepy session at least 1/2 point poorer as U.S. Treasuries extended data-induced losses. "It's been awfully quiet," one trader said, citing "very few" two-sided markets. A municipal analyst said dollar bonds closed Thursday's lightly traded session down 1/2, while high-grade issues worsened by nearly five basis points. Overall,the market was down 1/2, he said. Steeper losses were estimated by one trader, who judged the market off about 3/4 point. He also cited light action.   "I'd say there was one decent-sized list out (and) not an item on it traded," he said. The trader said the list originated from American Express, which has had a list out virtually every day for weeks. AmericanExpress could not be reached for comment. The trader also cited a smaller list, containing California paper, that traded. "It was only three items," the trader said. "It wasn't huge blocksize."   Players are probably less than eager to take on bonds ahead of a "non-event day" such as the Friday before the Labor Day Holiday weekend, he said. The Public Securities Association has recommended a 1400 EDT close for the municipal market Friday. Tuesday's session is apt to resemble a Monday, leaving only Wednesday and Thursday before the market receives Friday's August employment data, the trader said. The municipal market was also softer week to week. Reuters 10-year General Obligation Tax-Exempt Index backed up to  5.10 percent from a 5.00 percent the previous week.   In debt futures, the September municipal bond contract closed down 24/32 at 114-3/32. The September T-bond contract was down 21/32 at 108-4/32. The MOB spread was 191 ticks. In the government market, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 23/32 at 96-12/32 to yield 7.04 percent. Earlier, the Commerce Department said second quarter gross domestic product was revised higher to a 4.8 percent annualized rate. Economists expected an unchanged reading of 4.2 percent. The market also took in a 7.9 percent jump in July single-family home sales to an annual rate of 783,000 units. In new issues, Smith Barney Inc said it repriced Cleveland Ohio's $81.7 million parking bond issue, adjusting yields in several maturities and lowering to top yield in 2022 to approximately 5.838 percent from 5.85 percent. An analyst described pricing as "good." Smith Barney took over the deal after an attempt by Grigsby Brandford & Co to do it last week failed. --Kathie O'Donnell, 212-859-1655
