Senetek PLC said Thursday it named Anthony Cataldo, former chief executive of Management Technologies Inc, as chairman and chief executive, replacing Gerlof Homan.   The leadership change was part of a transition aimed at moving the company from a predominantly research and development phase to the commercialization of its products. "My focus will be to enhance shareholder value since Senetek's success story seems to be generally unknown in the investment community," Cataldo said in a statement. Senetek soon will seek to raise funds to complete research on its drug to treat male impotence and to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the product, Cataldo said in an interview.   In the interview, Cataldo said Senetek would seek to raise $5 million to $7 million through a convertible note financing. The company also would use profits from its Carme International Inc subsidiary to fund research. "Once the necessary financing and restructuring is in place, there is no reason why Senetek should not trade at a substantially higher market capitalization particularly since the wholly owned subsidiary company, Carme International Inc, has already begun to be profitable after a relatively short time period," Cataldo said in the statment. Before joining Seneteck, Cataldo said he ran his own financial consulting firm for about a year and was hired by Beverly, Mass.-based Palomar Medical Technologies Inc for investment banking work. Before that, Cataldo was chairman and chief executive of Management Technologies for five years before resigning last summer, he said. Homan will remain a director and focus on completing and expanding products in the health care market which address the needs of the aging population, Senetek said. 	   -- Reuter Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787
