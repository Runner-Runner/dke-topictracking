Mother Teresa, still gaining strength in her fight against malaria and a faltering heart, may be able to leave the hospital intensive care unit this week, officials said on Thursday. She should be out from ICU (intensive care unit) in a day or two, a hospital official, quoting a doctor at Woodlands Nursing Home, told Reuters. The legendary Roman Catholic missionary was admitted to the Calcutta hospital on August 20 with high fever and severe vomiting. Later, she suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria. But she has staged a recovery, and spoke for the first time since the outset of the illness on Tuesday -- her 86th birthday. Fed intravenously for almost a week, she has started a diet of barley, soup and milk. On Thursday, Mother Teresa sat up in bed with the help of a nurse and said early morning prayers, the hospital official said. Then she drank some milk. There have been no problems in the past 36 hours. She is gaining strength, the official said. Doctors said her heart continued to beat irregularly but was returning to normal. Several nuns from her order, the Missionaries of Charity, who were not allowed to see her for the past week, met her on Thursday. They looked visibly relieved, said an official at the hospital lobby.
