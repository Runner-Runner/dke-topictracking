East German construction workers on Thursday vowed to battle employers head on, promising to strike if employers go ahead with plans to cancel an existing wage contract. Andreas Steppuhn, head of the IG Bau union in the east German state of Saxony-Anhalt told German radio, "If the employers make good on their threats, it means the end of the cooling-off period (during which unions refrain from striking). Then we will immediately resort to strikes." In Germany, where unions remain extremely powerful, it is very rare for employers to cancel a wage contract, and the step usually signals they wish to take away some rights or benefits from workers. In this case, employers have threatened to cancel a wage contract which would give east German workers' a 1.85 percent pay rise, lifting their salaries to 95 percent of west German workers' wages, in October. A spokesman for the employers' association said that the appropriate parties had agreed to cancel the wage contract. The group has not yet made an official announcement however. Currently east German workers earn 92 percent of their west German colleagues' wages. The wage increase is scheduled to become effective in October and employers have threatened to cancel the contract on September 1. This new twist may escalate tensions already simmering in the construction industry after the industry last week launched a fresh attempt to set a minimum wage for the sector, urging other industry groups not to block the initiative as they have in the past. The building workers' union IG Bau and the two leading industry associations revealed a new agreement for a minimum hourly wage of 17 marks ($11.52) for west Germany and 15.64 marks for workers in the east -- considerably below levels they tried, but failed, to establish nationwide earlier this year.
