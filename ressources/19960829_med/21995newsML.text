Bangladeshi fishermen rescued five crew of a wrecked Indian trawler in the Bay of Bengal on Thursday, police said. They said the five were seen floating at high sea, some 100 km (60 miles) from Cox's Bazar coast, holding on to their battered vessel. The Indians told the rescuers their trawler had been damaged and its engine stopped working in a storm last month. "We survived by eating fish and water from the sea," one survivor told police at Cox's Bazar. No other details were available.
