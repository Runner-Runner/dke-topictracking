The Japanese government is considering subsidising two passenger plane projects that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. is undertaking with Boeing Co. and with Bombardier Inc. of Canada. "We are considering subsidising the two projects and whether or not we will actually do so will be clear in early September," an official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Thursday. Mitsubishi, Japan's largest heavy machinery maker, is developing a small passenger plane with Bombardier. It has also joined four other Japanese aircraft makers to help develop the next generation of Boeing's popular 747 jumbo jet. However, even if the ministry agrees to the subsidy plan, it will still have to get past a long line of government departments before Mitsubishi finally gets any money. The amount was not yet known. Boeing has been reported to be planning two new models of the 747 family and the total development cost would be $2 billion to $5 billion. Mitsubishi is conducting a feasibility study with Bombardier on a joint development of a 100-seat passenger plane, a spokesman said.
