Deutsche Bank AG said Thursday it will list an offshore mutual fund in Argentina. The fund will be the first of its kind to be listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. It will offer small investors locally and abroad a new alternative to invest in Argentine bonds, said Roberto Ros, managing director at Deutsche Bank Investment Management SA. The fund will invest in Argentine government and corporate bonds denominated in dollars in addition to U.S. and Canadian fixed income instruments. Db Argentine Bond Fund Shares is a product of Deutsche's South American Income Fund PLC listed in Ireland. Deutsche's locally listed bond funds achieved a return of 20 percent in the year ended July 30 this year but Ros said "this will be a conservative fund. I would hope for a 10 percent return." The listing of the fund has been approved by the Comision Nacional de Valores, the Argentine securities watchdog. A minimum investment of $5,000 is required. Deutsche Bank manages more than $50 billion in funds globally. The Argentine fund management industry has grown rapidly in the last couple of years since the introduction of private pension funds in 1994. Currently, some $4.0 billion is managed by the local pension funds. -- Axel Bugge, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 54 1 3180668
