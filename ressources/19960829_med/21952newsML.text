The European Union agreed on Thursday to increase by 300,000 tonnes the quota of German intervention barley available for export, France ONIC said. The EU's grain panel will add two tranches of 150,000 tonnes each to the existing allocation, it said.   Traders had been pressing for an increase of 300,000 tonnes to help cover part of what could be a large sale to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia provisionally bought 800,000 tonnes of optional barley on August 21, traders have said. Earlier on Thursday the EU's grain panel sold 234,324 tonnes of German intervention barley. The grain was mostly destined to help cover the Saudi sale, European grain industry sources said. The award left at 48,676 tonnes the current unsold allocation of German intervention barley. --Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432
