The U.S. Justice Department said Thursday it approved Ingersoll-Rand Co's acquisition of Zimmerman International Corp, a Michigan-based manufacturer of equipment used to lift and move heavy objects on assembly lines. The Justice Department's antitrust division said it allowed the deal after Ingersoll-Rand agreed to end its exclusive licensing arrangement with another manufacturer, Knight Industries. Zimmerman is the nation's largest manufacturer of such equipment, known as air balancers, while Knight ranks as the second largest, the department's said.
