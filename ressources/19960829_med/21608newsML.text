The level of China's foreign reserves was appropriate to the country's economic conditions, a senior monetary official said on Thursday. Zhou Xiaochuan, director-general of China's State Administration of Exchange Control, rejected suggestions that China's foreign reserves were too high. "From the administration's point of view, we don't feel (it is too high) this year," he told a news conference. China boasted the world's second largest foreign exchange reserves, at a record US$90.8 billion in July, compared with US$73.6 billion at the end of last year.
