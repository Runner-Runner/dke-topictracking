Ogden Quezon Power Inc, a unit of Ogden Corp, had secured final approval for its 440-megawatt coal fired power plant in the northern Philippines, the environment and natural resources department said on Thursday. The project was approved by local government officials in Quezon province, about 50 km (31 miles) east of Manila. Under Philippine rules, power projects have to be approved by provincial authorities as well as the national government. Environment officials said the full approval was granted after the company agreed on setting up a 200 million peso development and livelihood fund and a 400-million peso fund for reforestation, watershed management, health and environment enhancement. The company will also give 30.5 million pesos to fund projects such as bridges, provincial roads and the water supply system. It was not immediately known when the construction of the power plant would start. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
