The American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) business outlook index fell to 46.4 in August from 53.0 in July. The current component slipped to 45.4 from 51.4 in July, and the future component declined to 47.4 from 54.7. A reading of 50 indicates neutral sentiment, APICS said. "The growth in manufacturing activity has remained almost steady over the past five months," said an APICS report. The index is compiled monthly from a survey of manufacturing firms and is calculated by averaging respondents' ratings of current and future conditions.   Three of the four current component items fell in August. Only the employment measure rose, to 52.5 in August from 45.6 in July. Of the future component items, only production planning came in higher in the latest month, rising to 53.6 from 51.9. APICS said its index rose in July partly because fewer firms than usual shut down production facilities in that month. Therefore, the August decline in the Index reflects fewer start-ups than usual, it said. "For this reason we ought to consider the average (index) value over the past two months, which is 49.7," APICS said.   In the second quarter, the business outlook index averaged 50.6, APICS said. The August business outlook index was scheduled for release at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT on Thursday. Reuters released the report after another news service broke the embargo.
