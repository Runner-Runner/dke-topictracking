New York precious metals futures ended mostly lower for the third session Thursday, though little further activity is expected until after the U.S. holiday weekend. "Gold and silver have been trying to muster up a continuation of the past month's rally, but it looks like the attempt is failing," Analytics Research Corp's Maryland-based president Hans Kashyap said. COMEX December gold ended down 60 cents at $392.40, after trading in a $393.20-391.70 range. Total estimated volume was 14,000 lots.   In New York bullion trade, spot gold was quoted $387.60/388.00, from the London afternoon fix Thursday at $388.00 and the close in New York Wednesday at $387.90/388.40. COMEX December silver ended up $0.004 at $5.255 an ounce, after trading between $5.270 and $5.235. "We're just treading water here, with few people wanting to take on new positions ahead of the September first delivery day in silver Friday and the U.S. holiday Monday," North American Equity Services floor trader John Geraghty said. In U.S. economic news, July new home sales jumped 7.9 percent, the largest rise since January to an annual rate of 783,000.   Second quarter GDP was also revised up more than expected to 4.8 pct annual rate from 4.2 pct. But the implicit price deflator was only 1.8 pct and jobless claims rose in the latest week to 331,000. While gold prices are often seen as an indicator of inflation expectations, the minor recovery in gold prices in the past two months, suggests few investors are concerned about an inflation threat yet, analysts said. NYMEX October platinum ended down $2.40 at $400.70, after slipping to a session low at $399.50, the lowest level since mid-July for the contract. "Technical traders seem to be looking for stops in platinum below $400.00," PGM Brokers' floor trader Cathy Sarley said. "My feeling is we're going to be trying these numbers again tomorrow." NYMEX December palladium ended down $0.65 at $127.50. In overnight news, Russian platinum shipments to Japan under long term contract were expected to return to normal gradually after delays of up to three weeks, industry officials said. Japan is the world's largest consumer of platinum and Russia and South Africa are its main suppliers. Meanwhile, the Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB) bounced back from Wednesday's fall Thursday, helped by further sharp gains in crude oil and heating oil and some gains in soybeans. The CRB index was up 1.18 points, or 0.47 percent, at 249.68 near the close. The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which gives a higher weighting to the energy complex, was up 2.52 points, or 1.28 percent, at 199.04. --Clive McKeef, New York Commodities Desk, +1-212-859-1641.
