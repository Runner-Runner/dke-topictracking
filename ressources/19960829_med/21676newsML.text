Sex sells. Now, it will just be a little harder to sell it in Massachusetts. In a measure that harkens back to the Commonwealth's Puritan past, Massachusetts Governor William Weld Thursday signed into law the so-called "Foxy Lady Bill" allowing cities and towns to further regulate the zoning of adult entertainment establishments. "The new law brings state and local zoning regulations in line, allowing towns to require special permits not only for adult bookstores and video stores, but also for strip clubs like the Foxy Lady," said Weld at the signing ceremony. "This law gives communities...the best possible shield against sex shops setting up next to a school or bus stop or retirement home." The bill will allow municipalities to confine nude-dancing clubs to specially zoned areas. The measure was sparked by an attempt by the owner of a Providence, Rhode Island strip club called the Foxy Lady to open a similar club in Weymouth, a small city southeast of Boston.
