President Clinton, trying to become the first Democratic incumbent since Franklin Roosevelt to win re-election, urged Americans Thursday to let him lead them into the 21st century with an agenda that disdains the "old politics of Washington." "For four years now, we have worked to realize our vision for America. Our strategy is simple but profound: opportunity for all, responsibility for all, a strong American community where everyone has a place and plays a role," Clinton said in a speech prepared for the Democratic convention.   Excerpts of Clinton's speech, which included specific proposals on taxes and other domestic policy issues, were released to reporters several hours before he addressed the convention. "On issues that once tore us apart, we have changed the old politics of Washington. For too often, leaders asked 'who's to blame,?' We ask 'what are we going to do,?'" he said. Clinton promised to balance the budget but portrayed himself as a bulwark against excessive Republican efforts to shrink government. He also blasted Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole's plan for a $548 billion across-the-board tax cut
