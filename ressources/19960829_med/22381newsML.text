U.S. stocks are expected to open steady on Thursday, continuing their recent quiet tone. Markets will absorb a bevy of economic data this morning, with jobless claims, new homes sales and Gross Domestic Product all due by mid-morning. But even these figures are not expected to stir markets out of the August doldrums. "Unless the numbers are way off course, they probably won't move the market," said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. "It looks like two more slow days are in order for the rest of this week."   At 0830 EDT/1230 GMT the U.S. Labor Department is to report weekly jobless claims. Economists expect 330,000 new claims, up from 327,000 in the previous week. Revised second quarter GDP data are also due at 0830 EDT. Economists expect no change in the annual growth rate of 4.2 percent reported previously. New home sales for July are due at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. Economists are looking for 728,000 versus June's 734,000. Also at 1000 EDT, the Conference Board reports the July U.S. help wanted advertising index. The index rose to 85.0 in June from 80.0 in May.   With some much more closely watched economic data due next week, analysts doubted today's reports would carry enough weight for investors to abandon their wait-and-see attitude. "We've got NAPM (National Association of Purchasing Management) and monthly employment coming next week," said Zagorski, "Those are the significant ones." In Tokyo, stocks continued their slide after a surprisingly weak Bank of Japan tankan survey reignited concerns about economic growth. The Nikkei-225 fell 157 points to 20,553.   In London, U.S. stocks were lightly traded and little changed ahead of the heavy slate of economic data. The FTSE-100 fell 6.5 points to 3912.2. The dollar was little changed in late Tokyo trade and held to the middle of tight ranges in Europe. Intermediate- and long-term Treasuries were firm, with the benchmark 30-year bond up 6/32 to yield 6.97 percent. The S&P 500 index future eased 0.45 to 665.25.   The New York Times's Marketplace column reports that stock mutual funds are again seeing net cash inflows. The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column examines how Hilton Hotels Corp, in acquiring Bally Entertainment Corp, may win a key piece of property formerly owned by Bally affiliate Bally's Grand Inc. Bally Entertainment bought the property from 85 percent-owned Bally's Grand for a price some Bally's Grand minority shareholders feel was too low, the column says.
