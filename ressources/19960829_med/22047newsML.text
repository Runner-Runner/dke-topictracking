Pakistani stocks ended down in lacklustre trading on Thursday as investors, hit by political and economic uncertainty, stayed out ahead of the Friday-Saturday weekend, dealers said. The Karachi 100-share index fell 2.90 points, or 0.20 percent, to end at 1,419.09. Losers led gainers 198 to 73. "Trading volumes have fallen and only speculators are generating activity," dealer Manochar Jamal said. He said there were few prospects of a near-term recovery as all the economic indicators were weak. Lever Brothers fell 6.0 to 675 and Pak State Oil 4.0 to 331. -- Amir Zia 9221-5685192
