Baxter International Inc's $715 million acquisition of Immuno International AG will add new products such as fibrin sealants to Baxter's pipeline, chief financial officer Harry Kraemer Jr told reporters in a teleconference. The combination will immediately boost Baxter's biotechnology sales to $1.7 billion from $1.1 billion. Immuno produces fibrin sealants -- biological tissue adhesive for wound healing -- that are in use in Europe and are moving toward U.S. approval, Kraemer said.   Immuno also will bring to Baxter several vaccine products, including one to treat tick-borne encephalitis. Kraemer said the acquisition, expected to close by year-end, will build on other areas of Baxter's strength -- renal, cardiovascular and intravenous. "Immuno's strong infrastructure, research and development capabilities, melded with Baxter ... gives us the ability to generate very strong cash flow," he said.   Kraemer also said, "Baxter is on track and we will meet all stated commitments for both growth in our net earnings after taxes, earnings per share, and the operational cash flow that the company generates." He said the Deerfield, Ill.-based company's goal is for earnings in the high single digits in 1996 and cash flow in excess of $500 million. -- Chicago Newsdesk 312 408-8787
