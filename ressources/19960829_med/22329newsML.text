The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is expected to temporarily add reserves to the banking system on Thursday via seven-day fixed system repurchase agreements, analysts said. The Fed faces a huge add need ahead of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday and may add reserves with two operations, supplementing the seven-day RPs with five-day fixed system RPs, they said. "The add need is very large between now and September 6," said MCM MoneyWatch senior economist Astrid Adolfson.   She estimates the daily add need is $6.5 billion at the moment and will reach $8 billion next week. "They could do five-day fixed systems as well because they have a very large add need and haven't done as many coupon passes as in the past," Adolfson said, referring to the Fed's pattern of permanently adding reserves by buying Treasury securities to meet the seasonal growth in reserve needs. "If they don't do two operations today, they may come in tomorrow with four-day fixed systems," she added. Ahead of the 1130 EDT/1530 GMT bidding deadline, federal funds changed hands at 5-1/4 percent, on target. -- Isabelle Clary 212-859-1666
