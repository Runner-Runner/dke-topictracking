Brazilian inflation between July 21 and August 20 slowed to 0.28 percent, against 1.35 percent rise between June 21 and July 20 as measured by the IGP-M index released by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV). The IGP-M is composed by three other economic indicators. They are the IPA wholesale price index, which rose 0.22 percent in the period, the IPC consumer price index, which gained 0.22 percent in the period, and the INCC national index of construction costs, which advanced 0.74 percent. The IPA has a 60 percent weighting in the IGP-M, the IPC a 30 percent weighting and the INCC 10 percent, the FGV said. The IGP-M index, which measures inflation over ten-day intervals, is published by the independent research institute Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV). -- Alexandre Caverni, Sao Paulo newsroom, 55-11-2324411
