FCOJ settled higher apart from spot September as concerns about storms off south east U.S. raised concerns among dealers. "We are pretty sure we are seeing some short covering because of the tropical storms," said Jim Cordier of Allendale Commodities. "In the last couple of days the open interest in juice has lowered. People are jumping out of short positions rather than getting bullish." The charts also appeared good, with a double bottom formation at 106.50 to 106.60 basis November, but with strong resistance at 120.00 cents. November FCOJ went out 0.45 cent higher at 114.75 cents, traded 115.35 to 114.10 cents. Spot September was down 0.70 cent at 119.65 cents, narrowing the September-to-November spread which widened Wednesday. Two hurricanes, Edouard and Fran, were moving across the Atlantic and Caribbean seas towards the U.S. Thursday, with a third, Tropical Storm Gustav, brewing off Africa's coast. Brian Gonsalves of Weather Services Corp said Edouard will probably stay offshore, while Fran may eventually take a similar course. Gustav was days away from threatening anything. -- Huw Jones, New York Commodities 212-859-1646
