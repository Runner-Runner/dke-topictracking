Millfeed supplies remain tight, but prices were mostly steady amid light buyer interest Thursday. A few trades at higher prices were reported at Kansas City and interior Kansas/Oklahoma markets, but elsewhere dealers said buyers were absent. Buyers and sellers alike expect supplies to remain tight into next week because of holiday-shortened operations at flour mills. The U.S. Labor Day holiday Monday not only will shorten next week's mill operations, but many mills will not operate Saturday because of the holiday weekend.   The closely-watched Kansas City rail market traded at $123 per ton, up $3 from Wednesday's offer. --Chicago newsdesk 312-408 8720
