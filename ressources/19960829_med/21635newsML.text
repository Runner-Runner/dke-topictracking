Thai stocks ended slightly lower in moderate trade on Thursday after investors sold stocks because of disappointment over certain key economic data released by the central bank, brokers said. The SET index ended 0.25 point lower at 1,105.59 on 4.4 billion baht trade after posting some gains earlier in the day. Gainers led decliners 151 to 135 while 136 issues were unchanged. The SET-50 index slipped 0.21 point to 84.42. "The index fell after the central bank released key economic indicators in the afternoon. Investors weren't happy with some figures," said Lan Pajasalmi of First Asia Securities.   Brokers said investors were not happy with several figures including exports and the balance of payments. Investors were earlier optimistic that some of the key economic figures would be improved from the past few months. The index moved in positive territory during the morning session and hit its intraday high at 1,117.60 points, or up 11.76. It fell right after the Bank of Thailand released the economic indicators, brokers said. The cental bank data showed that January/July exports rose a small 3.8 percent year-on-year to 801.5 billion baht against about 25 percent growth in the same period a year ago.   The central bank data showed that the balance of payments showed a 17.1 billion baht deficit in July against a 20.5 billion baht surplus in June. Bangkok Bank topped the active list, unchanged at 218 baht. Finance One lost two to 108 and Electricity Generating dipped one to 75.50. Support is seen by some brokers at 1,100-point and resistance at 1,115 level on Friday. -- Suthep Chawla (662) 252-9950
