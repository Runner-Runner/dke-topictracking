CBOT corn futures closed higher on a rally in soybean futures with nearby September strong on prospects for light or no deliveries to be posted on the September Friday, traders said. Friday is first notice day for deliveries on the CBOT September contracts. Traders cited signals the market was in a technical trading range amid little fresh fundamental input. Corn sagged in early dealings. "There was a little follow through weakness from yesterday in corn," said Mark Cermak of O'Connor and Co. But "there was fair interest to buy into the December above $3.40," he said. Traders said the December contract appears stuck in a trading range of from $3.40 to $3.50 per bushel. Current Midwest weather appears conducive for crop development. "Until we get through September weather-wise, in corn the downside is limited," Cermak said. Meteorologists said warm, dry weather was forecast for much of the U.S. Midwest through next week. Corn closed 2-3/4 cents per bushel higher to two lower, with September up 2-3/4 at $3.70-1/2. Traders cited little impact from a Securities Corp of Iowa report pegging the 1996 U.S. corn crop at 8.82 billion bushels, above USDA's August outlook for 8.69 billion. Cargill Investor Services bull spread two million bushels of September/December and Dean Witter Reynolds spread 1.2 million September/December. Corn futures volume was estimated at 47,500, down from 61,497 Wednesday. In corn options FIMAT Futures bought 200 March $3.30 calls, sold 200 March $3.50 calls and sold 200 March $3.20 puts. USA Trading sold 250 December $4.00 calls at five cents. Corn options volume was estimated at 9,000, down from 10,660 Wednesday. Sam Nelson 312-408-8721
