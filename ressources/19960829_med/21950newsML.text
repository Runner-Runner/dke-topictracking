A.P. Moeller, the major Danish shipping, oil and gas group, said on Thursday it expected 1996 profits on shipping operations to slightly improve from 1995 while oil and gas earnings would remain unchanged. A.P. Moeller, Denmark's biggest privately-controlled group, issued forecasts on the activities of its two listed units, Dampskibsselskabet Svendborg A/S and Dampskibsselskabet af 1912 A/S and their joint operations (tankers, liners and oil and gas prospecting). The six-month report gave no interim figures as A.P. Moeller issues only whole year results. The company said, however, that first-half 1996 results were on par with 1995 H1 data. Combined net profit for 1995 was 1.81 billion crowns. Moeller said it expected shipping operations' profit to deteriorate in the second half of the year on H2 1995 due to lower container vessel freight rates and poor market conditions for gas and tanker ships. Shipping activities' full year 1996 profit before extraordinary, foreign exchange and securities items and advances would improve on the 974 million crown 1995 profit. Container traffic profitability increased in the first half of the year on first half 1995. A.P. Moeller cited stable conditions on routes from the United States to Asia and disappointing results in other directions due to lower U.S. imports and rates under pressure. It said container traffic profitability between Europe and Asia was satisfactory in both directions. Oil and gas production from Denmark's North Sea offshore fields rose by four and 15 percent respectively in the reporting period, compared to the first six months of 1995. Investments in three new fields --Harald, Svend and Roar -- and the expansion of the existing Tyra offshore field were currently being implemented. --Chris Follett, Copenhagen newsroom +45-33969652
