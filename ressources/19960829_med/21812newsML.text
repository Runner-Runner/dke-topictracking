NASA prepared on Thursday to haul shuttle Atlantis back to its hangar if twin hurricanes churning offshore threaten its seaside launch pad at Florida's Kennedy Space Centre. Space agency officials said they were ready to move the shuttle back to the safety of its assembly building as early as Friday if Hurricane Edouard with 130 mph (210 kph) winds fails to make a predicted turn to the north. Hurricane Fran, which appeared to be taking a more southerly track, could force the shuttle off the pad by Monday morning. "We are definitely keeping a close watch on the tropics," said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham. "We think Hurricane Fran is the one that will cause us to throw our hands in the air." Workers on Thursday planned to close the shuttle's cockpit hatch, switch off power and disconnect umbilicals in readiness for the 12-hour operation to move Atlantis back to the hangar. Atlantis was pulled off its launch pad earlier this summer when Hurricane Bertha skirted the east coast of Florida. NASA officials were meeting on Thursday to set an official launch date for Atlantis. They were expected to chose Sept. 14, two days later than planned, because of a scheduling conflict with a military rocket. Atlantis, already delayed six weeks by booster problems, would have been ready for launch on Sept. 12, but a U.S. Air Force Delta 2 rocket had already booked that date. Air Force tracking and safety equipment at Cape Canaveral can accommodate only one launch at a time, so the earlier scheduled Delta will take its turn first. Atlantis is to make a 10-day mission to collect U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid from the Russian Mir space station and drop off her replacement, John Blaha. Lucid, who has been aboard Mir since March, was due to come home in early August, but NASA postponed the mission to replace a pair of suspect booster rockets strapped to Atlantis.
