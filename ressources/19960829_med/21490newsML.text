Prices on the Mexican stock market fell sharply at the opening on news that a fresh guerrillaa attack in two southern states had left several people dead, dealers said. The market's main index fell 1.04 percent, or 35.35 points, to 3.375.39. "There is nervousness on the news of the guerrilla attack and also people are taking profits," said one dealer. The profit-taking came after the bolsa hit a record high on Wednesday.   It reached a new intra-day record high before closing down 0.667 percent, or 22.91 points, at 3,410.84. Officials said at least 13 people were killed when scores of masked rebels struck at police and military posts in the southern states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. The attacks were apparently launched by a new rebel force calling itself the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR). Share prices were also dragged down this morning by weakness on Wall Street, analysts said.   Volume was 7,016,595 shares. Two stocks rose, 35 declined and two were unchanged. -- Mara Luisa Aguilar, Mexico City Newroom (525) 728 9553
