Loss making Banco di Napoli said in a statement its two trillion lire capital increase would kick off on September 9 and run until October 8. Share rights for subscribing to the capital increase will be listed on the Milan bourse from September 9 until October 2. The cash call will see the issuing of two billion new ordinary shares worth a nominal 1,000 lire with nine new shares offered for every five ordinary or saving shares held. Ordinary equity will be written off completely, while the nominal value of savings shares will be cut to 373 lire from the current 1,000 lire. Subsequently the savings shares will be re-grouped to give three new 1,000 lire shares for every eight currently held. People who had the old Banco di Napoli ordinary and savings shares on July 27, 1996 will be able to get an option to buy one new ordinary share for every 15 ordinary, or savings share held. Banco di Napoli chalked up losses of 3.16 trillion lire in 1995, the biggest in Italian banking history and needs a massive injection of fresh funds to stay afloat. The government is underwriting the cash call and has said it will set up a rump company to take over much of its hefty bad debt portfolio. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501
