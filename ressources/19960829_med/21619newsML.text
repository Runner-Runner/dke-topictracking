Property and healthcare group Parkway Holdings Ltd said on Thursday it was unaware of any reason for the sharp increase in the price or turnover of its shares on Wednesday. Shares in Parkway rose 34 cents to close at Singapore $4.50 on Wednesday in active trade and jumped to a new year-high of S$4.68 on Thursday before sliding back to close at S$4.46. Parkway's shares and warrants topped the actives list on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) on Thursday. Parkway said in a statement to the SES: "This is to inform that the board is also not aware of any proposed take-over of the company as well as no notification of such intention from anyone has been received by the company." Dealers said earlier on Thursday there were rumours Malaysia's Berjaya Group could be accumulating shares in Parkway for a possible takeover. They attributed Berjaya's interest to a synergy of its pharmaceutical interests, namely through its associate Pantai Hospital Bhd. Parkway Holdings owns Gleneagles International Pte Ltd which runs the Gleneagles chain of hospitals. -- Singapore newsroom (65 8703199)
