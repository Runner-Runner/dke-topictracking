Colombia's state oil company, Ecopetrol, said Thursday that it plans to help finance an ambitious new investment program through the sale of oil- backed securities or other financial instruments abroad. Felix Betancourt, Ecopetrol's vice president in charge of finance, told a news conference the asset-backed securitization scheme, the first of its kind in Colombia, would involve the establishment of a trust somewhere outside of Colombia.   The trust would most likely be set up in an off-shore banking center like the Bahamas, he said, adding that Ecopetrol would cede its rights to it, for a five-year period, to a small portion of the country's oil output -- totalling up to about 13,000 barrels per day. The trust would then issue bonds or other instruments, or arrange syndicated loans backed by the oil under its control, to help finance Ecopetrol's investment plans, Betancourt said. He did not elaborate on details of the plan but said Ecopetrol hoped to raise up to $600 million through the novel approach to financing by the year 2000.   If oil-backed bonds are issued by the foreign trust, Betancourt said they would most likely have an annual yield of 8.5 percent. At the news conference, Ecopetrol announced plans to invest nearly $6 billion in development of the country's oil sector between 1996 and the year 2000, including a projected $1.27 billion in investment this year.   More than 20 percent of the new investment will be paid for with foreign credits and 63 percent will be financed directly by Ecopetrol. The remainder will come from what an outline of the investment plan described as "other sources" including asset- backed securitization.
