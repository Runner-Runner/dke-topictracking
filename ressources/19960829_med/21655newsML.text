Israeli prison officials took jailed Islamic militant Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to hospital on Thursday for medical tests, officials said. "Sheikh Ahmed Yassin...felt ill over the previous few hours and on orders from doctors was taken for tests at Assaf Harofeh hospital," said a spokesman for Israel's domestic security ministry. The 60-year-old Yassin, jailed by Israel since 1989, is serving a life sentence for ordering attacks by Hamas guerrillas against Israeli targets. The ailing Moslem cleric is the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist Hamas group which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks aimed at wrecking Israel-PLO peace deals. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has demanded that Israel release Yassin -- who is confined to a wheelchair -- on humanitarian grounds. Israel said last month after it recovered the body of a soldier abducted by Hamas seven years ago that it would consider freeing Yassin.
