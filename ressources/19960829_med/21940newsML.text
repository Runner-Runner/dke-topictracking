The record 51 tonne motor shipped to North America on a Lufthansa Cargo AG freighter today Thursday was worth three million marks, Steffen Rudkowsky, commerical manager logistics for Siemens AG industrial systems division, said. The company spent 180,000 marks to transport the electric motor by road from Berlin to Frankfurt, by air to Chicago and by road to Regina, Canada, he told Reuters at the motor loading at Frankfurt airport. Rudkowsky said Siemens would normally have shipped the motor by sea at a cost of 80,000-100,000 marks but had to fly the load because of production delays. "We first wanted to charter an Antonov but that would have cost three times more than with Lufthansa, and Lufthansa then said they would be able to fit the load in a Boeing," he said. A Siemens statement said the 28,000kW electrical motor, with the power of 500 Golf class cars, is one of the heaviest pieces of cargo carried on a scheduled freighter service. It will power a compressor pumping gas through the 14,000 kilometre network of TransCanada Pipelines, the statement said. Lufthansa Cargo said earlier the 51-tonne load, due to depart on its overnight Chicago freighter service, was its heaviest ever shipment. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44-171-542-7706 Fax+44-171-542-5017
