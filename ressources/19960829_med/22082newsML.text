-- Morgan Keegan & Co banking analyst John Moore initiated coverage of Affinity Technology Group Inc with a "speculative buy" rating. -- The analyst set earnings estimates on Affinity for fiscal 1996 of a loss of $0.19 per share and for the company to turn a profit of $0.45 per share in fiscal 1997. -- In a short statement, Moore said he believes Affinity could tranform the $1 trillion installment debt market with its technology for electronically initiating and processing consumer loans. -- Affinity has created a proprietary, closed-loop automated lending system, which it calls the Decision Support System (DSS). -- "Banks buy systems that work -- not cutting edge technology. They have demonstrated appetites for proven technologies that can reduce expenses and enhance convenience for the customer," Moore wrote. "We believe that Affinity may well be such a product," he said. -- The stock was up 1-3/4 to 10-3/4 in mid-afternoon trading Thursday. -- E. Auchard, Wall Street bureau, 212-859-1736
