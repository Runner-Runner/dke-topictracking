Calcutta shares staged a mild recovery on Thursday at the Calcutta bourse on Thursday on short covering and buying support by foreign funds, brokers said. Select blue-chips showed late-trading gains on hopes that the finance minister may announce some sops during the budget debate in parliament. Brokers said that indirect tax benefits like lower excise duties may be given to steel firms which have been hit by increased competition after import duties cuts. "There have been signs of foreign funds buying again today. The rise is not purely technical. Traders expect some measures from the finance minister to bolster sentiment in capital markets which have taken a beating after the budget presented late last month," said stock analyst Mathew Easow. Brokers however said that volumes were still very low since Indian mutual funds were absent from Thursday's trading.
