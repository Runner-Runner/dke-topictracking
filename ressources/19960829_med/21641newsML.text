Japanese giant Mitsubishi on Thursday became the latest foreign entrant to Taiwan's fast liberalising telecommunications market, announcing the formation of an eight-partner joint venture. Mitsubishi said it and its partners would invest up to T$10 billion (US$363 million) to establish an independent telecom network on the island, something allowed only since parliament voted to end the government telecom monopoly. "Once we get the licence to set up a new telecom company, a total of T$6 billion to T$10 billion would be invested in the joint venture," Mitsubishi manager Lin Shen-chih said by telephone. Under reforms launched in January, foreign investors can own stakes of up to 20 percent in Taiwan telecom ventures. Mitsubishi will hold just five percent of its Taiwan venture, with foreign partners Suez and Millcon holding 15 percent between them. Taiwan's Tung Ho Steel, Cathay Life Insurance, Mercuries and Associates will hold 16.5 percent each, Lin said. Yuen Foong Yu, Taiwan Telecom Network and local individual investors would hold 10 percent stakes.   A memorandum of understanding was signed in July. The partnership is the latest in a string of ventures linking Taiwan enterprises and overseas telecom powers since the island opened its long-closed telecom market in January. Major new foreign investors, all allied with local partners, include U.S. giants Sprint and Air Touch Communications, Hong Kong Telecom and Singapore Telecom.
