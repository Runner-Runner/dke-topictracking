The top executives of Richfood Holdings Inc. told shareholders on Thursday that the grocery wholesale distributor was expected to post sales of $5.5 billion by the year 2000, up from $3.25 billion. John Stokely, Richfood's president and chief operating officer, told Reuters after the annual meeting that the company would grow internally, adding new customers, or acquiring other grocery wholesale distributors. "We feel like there is tremendous opportunity," said Stokely, who becomes chief executive in January. Donald Bennett will remain the company's chairman. If Richfood hits the $5.5-billion mark, it would be poised to become the country's third-largest grocery wholesale distributor. It now ranks No. 4 behind Fleming Cos Inc., Supervalu Inc., and Wakefern Food Corp. During his remarks to shareholders, Stokely hinted that Richfood would have some type of "exciting" news in the next few weeks or months. He would not elaborate. However, analysts suspect Richfood might announce adding major customers or making another acquisition. Much of Richfood's growth in the past five years has been through acquisitions. Its revenue was $3.25 billion for the fiscal year ended April 27, up from $2.99 billion the previous fiscal year, and $1.01 billion in 1991. Net income for fiscal 1996 was $37.1 million, or $1.19 per share, after a $12 million one-time charge for expenses relating to its merger with Supe Rite Corp. as well as a $2.2 million extraordinary loss related to early debt retirement. Excluding the charge and loss, earnings were $47 million, or $1.51 a share. That compares with $39.2 million, or $1.26, in the previous fiscal year. Richfood doubled its size last year when it acquired Harrisburg, Pa.-based Super Rite, making it the fourth-largest grocery wholesaler.
