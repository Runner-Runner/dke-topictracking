Data released today revising U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product growth upwards to 4.8 percent from a previous estimate of 4.2 percent show that strong growth can continue to raise incomes without sparking inflationary pressures, a top White House economist said. The GDP data "strengthens our view that the U.S. economy is achieving the kind of strong economic growth that can raise America's living standards," White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman Joseph Stiglitz said in a statement. "A downward revision to inventory investment and upward revisions to final sales and producers' fixed investment provide additional signs that the prospects for further strong economic growth in the future are excellent," he added. "Today's report on corporate profits indicated that in the second quarter, profits were as high as at any time in the past 30 years as a percent of GDP. These figures confirm that strong economic growth is helping to raise real incomes and can continue to do so without creating inflationary pressures," he said. The Commerce Department Thursday said Q2 corporate profits fell 0.3 percent to $407.4 billion from $408.8 billion in Q1.
