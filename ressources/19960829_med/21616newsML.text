Zhuhai Special Economic Zone Lizhu Pharmaceutical Group Inc said on Thursday that it posted a decline of 21 percent in its interim net earnings for 1996 from 54.86 million yuan in the first half of 1995. In its interim report published in the Securities Times, Lizhu said that under Chinese accounting standards it had audited net profits of 43.12 million yuan in the first two quarters of this year. Per share earnings sank to 0.22 yuan from 0.28 yuan in the 1995 period, and main operating income fell to 313.26 million yuan from 365.22 million yuan. The drug producer said the earnings slide was caused by sharpening competition, forcing it to trim prices and lift sales commissions. Lizhu said it plans to expand its production and sales by acquiring some weaker counterparts in inland China in the second half of this year. It gave no details on the plan. In its annual report last year, the company said that under Chinese accounting standards it had after-tax profits of 80.15 million yuan for 1995, down 20.73 percent from 113.21 million yuan a year earlier. Lizhu blamed the earnings decline on price hikes for raw materials and on Beijing's lowering of export tax rebate levels. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6441
