In the world of vampires, only Dracula is bigger than Cayne Presley. The Texas blood-sucker who recently disclosed her habit of drinking human and animal blood has become an overnight sensation, unable to drive down the streets in this dusty border city without people honking, waving or staring. Boxes of mail arrive at her door each day while the phone rings constantly from reporters calling from Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico, France, England and Australia, all begging for interviews. "I really wasn't expecting this," said Presley, a 38-year-old night security guard who first began drinking blood when she was nine. "I guess I'm a star, or a freak." Presley's sudden stardom came after she gave an interview to an author writing a non-fiction book about vampires in the United States and titled "Something in the Blood." A follow-up interview with Reuters sparked a flood of interest in her blood-sucking lifestyle. "They all want to know if I sleep in a coffin and if I have fangs," Presley said on Thursday. She said she drinks one or two glasses of blood a day, sometimes offering human donors sex in return for their blood or else turning to a local butcher who gives her cow blood. Although Presley does not have fangs, some have told her she does look a little like a vampire because she's tall, thin and pale with jet-black hair. She also always dresses in black and wears deep red lipstick. For years, Presley said she was ashamed of her hunger for blood and hid the habit from everyone but the closest of her friends. Then one day a former boyfriend blabbed about Presley's thirst to all her friends and co-workers. Some were disgusted or scared but others took it in stride. Presley said she was not bothered by the current blaze of publicity. "I want to get the word out. We're not blood-thirsty killers. We're just blood thirsty." She said she has received mail from "fans" interested in becoming vampires or offering themselves as donors. "That's good because I was down to just one donor," Presley said, explaining that she pricks a donor on the inside of the arm and then sucks gently so as not to collapse a vein. "It's great, better than sex, more intimate. You're trusting each other with your lives. And not just for me. People get addicted to me (drinking their blood)," she said. But not all of Presley's mail is from fans. She received at least one letter from an Ohio man pledging to come to her home and drive a stake through her heart. She brazenly wrote him back to "come and try." Presley is one of an estimated 8,000 vampires in the United States, according to experts interviewed in "Something in the Blood."
