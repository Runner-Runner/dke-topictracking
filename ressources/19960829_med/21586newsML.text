Malaysian car retailer Cycle & Carriage Bintang Bhd said on Thursday that it expects results for the year to be higher than 1995 "barring unforeseen circumstances". The franchise holder for Mercedes Benz and Mazda vehicles in Malaysia made the comment in its earnings statement for the half-year ended June 30, 1996. It said that with the economic outlook continuing to be positive, and the upgrading and modernisation of public transportation system and infrastructure developments, "demand for the Group's products is expected to remain strong." For the full year ended December 31, 1995, the company posted net profit of 77.32 million ringgit or 80.2 cents a share. Turnover was 1.39 billion ringgit. During the first six months of 1996, it earned a net profit of 39.47 million ringgit or 40.8 cents a share and turnover of 701.99 million ringgit. It said that demand for Mercedes passenger cars remained strong during the period, with sales of the C-Class and S-Class models improving from the corresponding 1995 period. But sales of the E-Class were lower than in 1995 because the old model was phased out at the end of 1995 and the locally assembled new E-Class was only available for sale from the second quarter of 1996, it said. Higher sales of logging trucks in East Malaysia helped the performance of its Mercedes commercial vehicle operation, it said. Mazda vehicle operations also performed better in the first half of 1996 versus 1995, it said. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603 230 8911)
