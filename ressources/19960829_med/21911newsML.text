Lloyds Register, the shipping resigration and classification agency, was chosen to by the United Nations to field 32 customs inspectors in Iraq as part of the oil-for-food deal, diplomats said on Thursday. The inspectors will watch port areas as well as Iraq's borders with Jordan and Turkey. Their presence in Baghdad is necessary before the oil-for-food plan can be implemented. Earlier the United Nations chose the Dutch-based Saybolt company to send 14 oil experts to Iraq and Turkey to monitor the oil-for-food accord, which allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy humanitarian goods for its people suffering under U.N. sanctions. The plan will be implemented after both the customs and oil inspectors are on the ground in Iraq, expected in the next week or two. Secretary-General Boutros Boutro-Ghali has to report to the Security Council that all arrangements are in place and the program can begin.
