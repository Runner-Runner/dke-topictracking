Most Argentine manufacturing companies expect to boost their output this year, according to a survey quoted by local news agencies Thursday. According to the survey by the Argentine Industrial Union business lobby, 58 percent of companies expect to increase output this year and 69 percent said output should rise in 1997. Thirty-two percent foresaw steady production levels in 1996, while 11 percent said they would produce less.   Half of the 400 respondents expected their profits to rise this year, and 60 percent thought they would earn more in 1997. But only 38 percent said that they would invest more this year than in 1995. Some 45 percent of companies said they planned to boost investment next year. Most companies, 62 percent, said that they expected to have the same number of workers this year as last year. Some 19 percent said they would hire more employees, but 18 percent said they would be reducing staff levels. Asked about their luck since the start-up of the Mercosur customs union last year, 44 percent said they were exporting more to fellow member countries Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Seventy-one percent of firms reported no loss of Argentine market share as result of the formation of the pact. The reports made no mention of when exactly the companies were surveyed or what error margin the poll had. -- Jason Webb, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541 318-0655
