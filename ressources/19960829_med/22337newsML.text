Disney/ABC International, a unit of Walt Disney Co, and the KirchGroup of Germany signed a 10-year exclusive pay television agreement covering all Disney live-action movies. The pact also calls for development of premium Disney Channel specificially for Germany, the companies said in a news release. No value was placed on the agreement, and a spokeswoman was not immediately available.   Kirch last month agreed to pay $1 billion for long-term pay-TV rights to films from MCA, a unit of Seagram Co, and has also signed a long-term deal with Viacom, another leading U.S. entertainment group. Kirch, a leading media company in Germany, on July 28 launched a new television service called DF1 and chairman Leo Kirch was quoted as saying the Disney films will be shown on that service. "Particularly important in this respect is the prospect of carrying The Disney Channel itself," Kirch said.   Disney said it will retain full-ownership of the German version of The Disney Channel, a family-oriented service long established in the United States and with tailored versions already distributed in Taiwan, Australia and Britain. The Disney Channel will be sold as a premimum service in Germany and was just the latest step in Disney/ABC's campaign to launch Disney Channels in many markets outside the United States, according to Etienne de Villiers, president of Disney/ABC International Television. Disney, which acquired the ABC Television network a year ago, already has substantial European TV interestss, including 50 percent of Super RTL, 37.5 percent of cable-service TM3, and 23 percent of RTL2. It's live-action studios include Disney, Hollywood and Touchstone. -- Michael Connor 212-859-1713
