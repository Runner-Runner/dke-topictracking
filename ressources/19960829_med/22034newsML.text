The Sri Lankan rupee closed slightly weaker on Thursday after a state bank started buying the dollar to cover import bills, brokers said. The rupee ended at 55.57 to the dollar after opening at 55.54, they said. "There was substantial buying based on genuine demand by one state bank," a Commercial Bank dealer said. Earlier in the day, the Central Bank fixed its buying and selling rates at 55.3880/56.5070 to the dollar, pushing the U.S. unit higher by 3.75 local cents from Tuesday. The market was closed on Wednesday for a public holiday.   Some dealers said the dollar stayed firm purely due to buying witnessed on Thursday by the state bank. "If the buying interest was not there, I'm sure the dollar would have slided against the rupee," one broker said. Overnight call money closed at 13.5 percent with the market well supplied, dealers said. It ended at 14.5 percent on Tuesday. -- Mohan Samarasinghe (941) 434319
