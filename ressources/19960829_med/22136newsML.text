U.S. Midcontinent spot unleaded gasoline and diesel differentials were steady late Thursday as traders assessed their positions at month's end, traders said. "It's the calm before the storm," said one trader, referring not to the hurricanes brewing in the Atlantic but to instability expected in the Midwest cash markets in the coming weeks as a flood of shipments enter the market. The Explorer pipeline this week froze shipments on an over-nominated early September cycle as barrels were shifted from Gulf Coast refiners into Group Three due to strong prices, traders said.   Outages were trimming output at Conoco, Marathon, BP and Farmland refineries in the region, and the refinery demand in turn was dampening some of the bearish effects of the glut of product in the market, traders said. Total Petroleum plans to take a catalytic cracker down next week for maintenance at its 68,000 barrel per day refinery in Ardmore, Okla., and is in the process of idling its 56,000 barrel per day Arkansas City, Kansas refinery. Chicago unleaded for September deliveries was talked 0.75/1.0 cent over the print, while Group Three unleaded was talked 0.50/0.75 cent over for late-August deliveries. Chicago low sulphur diesel was heard done 2.10 cents over the print for September deliveries. Group Three low sulphur diesel eased to 2.75/3.0 cents over for August deliveries. High sulphur diesel and jet/kero differentials were unchanged in quiet late trade. -- Houston Bureau 713 210-8508
