NYMEX electricity futures finished lower Thursday, extending Wednesday's loss tied to forecasts of moderate weather in much of the western U.S. next week after a recent heat spell. Today's decline in futures prices mirrored similar softness in the western physical market, brokers and traders said. "We're entering into a 'shoulder' month. We're going to have milder weather," said one Northwest utility trader, adding some participants were beginning to liquidate some of their long positions. October California-Oregon Border (COB) futures settled down 36 cents at $15.75 per megawatt hour after traded between $15.65 and $15.80. November COB finished down 30 cents at $16.55. Active deferred COB contracts ended 20 to 40 cents lower. October Palo Verde (PV) futures settled down 20 cents at $16.30 per MWh after traded as low as $16.10. November PV ended down 45 cents at $15.20. Other active PV months ended down 45 to 60 cents lower. Brokers and traders assessed technically support for the October COB at $15.30 and October PV $15.40. NYMEX estimated 225 COB and 93 PV contracts were sold today. -- New York Power Desk +1 212 859 1622
