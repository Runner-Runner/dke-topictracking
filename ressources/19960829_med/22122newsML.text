Northeast Utilities will update the economic analysis of its Connecticut Yankee nuclear plant to determine whether it remains an "economic producer" of electricity, the company said Thursday. The 582 megawatt (MW) station in Haddam Neck, Conn., was shut July 22 due to increased safety concerns after a recent inspection by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. "CY (Connecticut Yankee) has had an excellent record of performance for the past 29 years, including a 359-day run that ended last month. It is in very good condition," said Jere LaPlatney, the plant's director in a statement. The utility decided to begin a scheduled refueling outage six weeks early as well as perform necessary work on improving safety-related systems at the plant. "If this update shows, as I hope it will, that operating CY continues to be in the best interests of our consumers throughout New England, we'lll complete all activities required to demostrate CY's readiness to restart, reload fuel, and restart the reactor on the path of excellence we've committed to achieve," LaPlatney said. This update to the economic analysis, typically performed every two years and last completed in 1994, will take approximately two months, NU said, adding refueling and maintenance activities will continue. NU said it did not set a schedule when Connecticut Yankee would resume operation. The company earlier said it hoped to return the plant in service in late autumn. The Connecticut Yankee plant is operated by NU, and owned by NU and seven other New England utilities. Separately, all three units at NU's Millstone nuclear power complex in Waterford, Conn., have been out of service since March 31, also due to safety concerns. The units have a combined generating capacity of almost 2,700 MW. --New York Power Desk +1 212 859 1622.
