White House economic adviser Laura Tyson said Thursday it was too early to determine growth in the third quarter following a strong second quarter, but said the economy was very healthy. "The key thing is the trajectory of the economy, which is sound and strong," Tyson said in an interview with Reuter Financial Television. "It is going to continue to grow," she said. "The unemployment rate is going to stay down. The investment rate is going to stay up. The inflation rate is low. This is a very sound situation." Tyson said President Clinton's proposed capital gains tax break for some home sales would eliminate tax considerations for most home sellers and help simplify their tax returns. She said the tax break, coupled with other policies to encourage home ownership, will help enhance the health of the housing sector.
