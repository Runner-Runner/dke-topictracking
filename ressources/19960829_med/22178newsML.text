Spot electricity prices in U.S. Southeast were firmer Thursday amid easing fears about the possibility of Hurricane Edouard hitting the southern part of the eastern seaboard, market sources said. Earlier this week, regional participants were worried thick clouds and heavy rains would sharply reduce power demand if the storm were to arrive over the weekend. The latest forecasts showed the storm will likely turn northwest from its current course, away from the East Coast, but warned of two new tropical storms developing over the Atlantic Ocean. In the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) district, next-day prices for non-firm, peak electricity were quoted in the $18.00 area, near unchanged from earlier this week, market sources said. SERC peak power for Saturday was quoted at $18.50-$19.00, and for Sunday and Monday at $17.50-$18.00. Off-peak SERC electricity for the three-day weekend was assessed at $17.50-$18.00. Electricity in the Tennessee Valley Authority distribution network was offered at $18.50 for Saturday and $17.50 for Sunday and Monday, up from $15.00 earlier this week, brokers and traders said. At the Georgia-Florida border, prices for Friday delivery were talked in the $23.00-$24.00 range, and for weekend delivery $22.00-$23.00, compared with $21.00-$22.25 earlier this week. Within the Florida pennisula, electricity for next-day delivery was valued at $26.00-$27.00, compared with quotes of $25.00-$27.00 earlier this week. The SERC district includes Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolina, and parts of Virginia, Tennessee and Mississippi. --R Leong, New York Power Desk +1 212 859 1622
