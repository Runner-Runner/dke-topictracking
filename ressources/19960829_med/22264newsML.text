Trans World Airlines Inc said Thursday it signed a contract to purchase a St. Louis County office building to house its world headquarters. The building, with 87,000 square feet of space, was purchased from McDonnell Douglas Corp. It is located in Hazelwood, Mo., near TWA's other facilities at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. Financial terms were not disclosed. The airline will begin moving into the building this winter, with completion of the move expected in the first quarter of 1997. TWA said its lease at One City Centre in St. Louis would expire in February 1997. Reuters Chicago Newsdesk - 312-408-8787
