Private investment firm Cypress Group has signed a definitive agreement to buy industrial company AMTROL Inc for $218.9 million, or $28.25 per share, the companies said Thursday. Shareholders owning about 37.8 percent of AMTROL common stock, including members of senior management, have agreed to approve the transaction, they said. The deal calls for John Cashman, former chairman and co-chief executive officer of R.P. Scherer Corp, to become chief executive officer of the new company. Cashman resigned from R.P. Scherer in March.   The transaction will be structured as a merger between AMTROL and Cypress affiliate A.I. Acquisition Inc. Shares of AMTROL soared 6-7/8 to 27-1/8 in early trade. The transaction is expected to enable AMTROL to aggressively pursue international growth and the introduction of new products, said AMTROL Chairman Kenneth Kirk. AMTROL produces and markets flow and expansion control technology used in water systems and heating, ventilation and air conditioning products. Cypress Group manages a private equity fund that closed in February with commitments of more than $1 billion. It recently bought a 44 percent stake in theater operator Cinemark USA Inc. -- Robin Sidel 212/859-1723
