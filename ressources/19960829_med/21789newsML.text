A late rally in soybean futures boosted CBOT wheat futures to a mostly higher close, traders said. But gains were limited by only routine exports, good harvest weather for the U.S. spring wheat crop and on long liquidation in the September, they said. Positioning in the September was noted before Friday, first notice day for deliveries on that month. Traders now are expecting the delivery tally to range from two million to five million bushels. Short covering after Wednesday's sharp break was noted. Wheat futures volume was estimated at 13,000, down from 17,673 Wednesday. In wheat options Tenco Inc sold 200 March $5.00 calls and Tenco Inc sold 200 March $5.20 calls. Wheat options volume was estimated at 2,500, up from 2,198 Wednesday. Wheat futures closed 4-1/4 cents per bushel higher to 1/2 lower, with September unchanged at $4.51-1/4. Sam Nelson 312-408-8721
