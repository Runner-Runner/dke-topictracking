NYCE cotton futures ended higher but the gains were due to bullish technical signals rather than any major fundamental issues such as storms off the U.S. coast, market sources said. Jarral Neeper of Calcot said much of the day's gains were technical in nature as funds tried to establish a foothold on the long side. USDA export sales figures released Thursday were pretty neutral, Neeper said. "Prices need to be a little higher to get cotton out of growers hands. There is just not a lot of cotton to ship right now," he added. USDA said U.S. sales of upland cotton for export totaled 29,000 bales in week ending August 22, down 34 percent from the four week average. USDA forecast fiscal year 1997 cotton exports of 1.5 million tonnes, compared to 1.7 million tonnes in the present fiscal year which ends September 30. December cotton went out 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound, traded 77.34 to 76.15 cents. Spot October was up 1.01 cents at 76.32 cents. Weather Services Corp said Hurricane Edouard would probably stay offshore, with Hurricane Fran likely to take a similar course. Tropical Storm Gustav was no threat yet. -- Huw Jones, New York Commodities 212-859-1646
