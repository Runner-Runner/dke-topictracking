ValuJet Inc. mechanics will decide next month whether to be represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the union said Thursday. Ballots will be mailed to the airline's 78 in-house mechanics on Sept. 4 by the National Mediation Board, which supervises union elections in the airline and railroad industries, and will be counted on Oct. 2, the Teamsters said. Following the May 11 crash of one of its planes near Miami, the grounded airline was criticized by federal officials for contracting out its maintenance work. The Teamsters said the in-house mechanics are seeking union representation "to protect their jobs and to expand the airline's in-house capabilities." "Giving ValuJet mechanics more of a say in their company will be good for the mechanics and good for the flying public," Teamsters President Ron Carey said in a statement.
