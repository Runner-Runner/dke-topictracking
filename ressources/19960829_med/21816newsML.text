The U.S. Agriculture Department Thursday forecast U.S. agricultural exports in fiscal year 1997 would decline to $58 billion, down $2 billion from the record $60 billion seen for fiscal 1996. USDA said despite strong prices, wheat, feedgrain and cotton export volume would drop and reduce sales of those commodities by $4 billion. Oilseed exports are expected to rise by $800 million and livestock, poultry and fruits and vegetables are seen gaining more than $1 billion. USDA pegged U.S. wheat exports at 25.0 million tonnes in fiscal 1997 versus 32.0 million tonnes the prior year.   U.S. wheat faces stiff competition from producers like Argentina, Australia and Canada, who are expected to enter the market with increased supplies this year at lower prices than U.S. grain. USDA forecast corn exports at 51.5 million tonnes versus 55.0 million tonnes seen for fiscal 1996. It estimated fiscal 1997 U.S. soybean exports at 22.3 million tonnes, down slightly from 22.4 million tonnes seen for 1996 and pegged cotton exports at 1.5 million tonnes versus 1.7 million tonnes forecast for fiscal 1996. The fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept 30.   Overall, USDA estimated U.S. exports of bulk commodities would total 109.1 million tonnes in fiscal 1997, down sharply from this year's forecast 120.2 million tonnes because of tight U.S. supplies and abundant crops worldwide. U.S. agricultural imports were forecast at a record $32 billion in fiscal 1997, up $500 million from this year. USDA raised its fiscal 1996 import estimate by $1 billion from the earlier $30.5 billion. Agricultural trade is a consistent bright spot in the U.S. balance of trade picture. USDA projected a trade surplus of $28.5 billion for this year and $26 billion in fiscal 1997. Exports account for about 25 cents of each dollar in cash receipts by U.S. farmers.
