A key panel of California lawmakers failed to reach agreement on a plan to raise tolls to fund the retrofit of several toll bridges in the state, state officials said on Thursday. Earlier this month, lawmakers on the legislative conference committee reached a compromise under which tolls on several bridges would increase by $1 to raise over $100 million annually. But lawmakers on the committee failed to agree on the duration of the surcharge by the Wednesday midnight deadline for legislation action, state officials said.   The Legislature's 1995-1996 session ends at midnight Saturday. State transportation officials say $2.075 billion is needed to strengthen the state bridge projects. About $650 million will come from a $2 billion bond measure approved by voters in March. Lawmakers in Sacramento have been debating ways to cover the projected $1.425 billion shortfall. If lawmakers would have agreed on a plan to boost bridge tolls, California would likely have issued hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue bonds secured by the surcharge.
