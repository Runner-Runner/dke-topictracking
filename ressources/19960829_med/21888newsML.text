The Republican brainchild "Freedom to Farm" act is too popular for Congress to alter its basic structure, lawmakers and industry analysts said. The "Freedom to Farm" act guarantees annual payments to farmers and removes most controls over what they grow. The act, signed reluctantly by President Clinton in April, is seen as biggest change in 60 years of U.S. farm supports, erasing a New Deal-era system which required farmers to obey acreage limits in order to get subsidies.   "Our nation's farmers are tired of government control. They support the Republican reform," the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Agriculture committees. Two private analysts, Randy Russell and Martin Abel, said there was little impetus in farm country to rewrite the law. Most farmers have prospered from two years of high grain prices, which show little sign of weakening soon. "There just won't be support for changes," said Russell, who contended farmers preferred the fewer and simpler crop rules of the new law. Earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said "radical" change would not be sought in "Freedom to Farm" for now. Instead, Democrats were looking at a stronger crop insurance program or innovations like revenue assurance, which would pay farmers when their output or market prices was catastrophically low.
