Housecall Medical Resources said on Thursday it expects its fourth quarter earnings and revenues to result in a net loss, below previously expected levels. It did not say what those levels were. Housecall said it hopes to complete a financial review by September 12 to explain lower-than-expected fourth quarter earnings. The company attributed the loss to the failure of its non-Medicare infusion therapy, hospice and nursing services to meet budgeted revenues, and from limits on Medicare reimbursement for certain services provided in the quarter.
