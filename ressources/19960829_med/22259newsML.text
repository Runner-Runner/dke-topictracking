Back Yard Burgers Inc said Thursday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in its favor this week, backing a lower court decision to give the company summary judgment as to all claims by former franchisees Jerry and Helen Morrison. The company said legal counsel for remaining franchisee litigants Pezzecca Enterprises Inc, Chris Powell and Scott Townsend have announced intentions to dismiss their appeals pending before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610
