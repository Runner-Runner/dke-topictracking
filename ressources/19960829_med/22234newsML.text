President Bill Clinton plans to propose a $3.43 billion initiative designed to move welfare recipients to work, White House aide Gene Sperling told reporters on Thursday. The initiative has three parts -- a tax incentive worth up to $5,000 to a firm hiring a long-term welfare recipient, money for local authorities to develop job initiatives for welfare recipients and a tax credit for equity investment in community banks, Sperling said. Administration officials disclosed the plans earlier this week as well as the revenue-raising measures to pay for them.
