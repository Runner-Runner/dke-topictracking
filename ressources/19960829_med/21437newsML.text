Ecuador's Finance Minister Pablo Concha said Thursday he will announce the government's economic plan in two months but said that in the next few days he will come up with some individual measures. "The plan will be ready in a couple of months," Concha told reporters. "But we will announce individual measures such as the scrapping of a subsidy on domestic gas in a few more days." New populist President Abdala Bucaram announced weeks ago he would eliminate a subsidy on domestic gas which amounts to some $200 million per year and redirect the cash towards social funds. But Central Bank manager Augusto de la Torre had said earlier the funds would be used to reduce the country's fiscal gap, which according to the bank amounts to one percent of GDP. Concha said he was studying a mechanism to compensate lower income sectors from the likely increase in gas, but denied he was planning to raise wages. "No subsidy will be made up by salary increments," Concha said. He also said the government would maintain the subsidy on diesel oil for electrical companies discarding any price readjustment in that sector. And he admitted that it would not be possible to implement one of Bucaram's electoral promises of scrapping a decree that allows for monthly hikes in the price of oil. "Our fiscal reality is so dramatic that eliminating that mechanism is not a possibility," he said. Former conservative President Sixto Duran Ballen implemented the system by which oil is subject to monthly price readjustments. -- Maria Veronica Barreiros, Quito Newsroom + 5932 258433
