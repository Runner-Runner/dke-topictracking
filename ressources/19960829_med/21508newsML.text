Argentine President Carlos Menem said at an impromptu press conference on Wednesday that Congress will pass the government's economic measures before October. The President also said that "all Peronist Party legislators, deputees and senators alike," will support the initiatives.   Menem reaffirmed that the government's economic policies are "non-negotiable and irreversible." "Some stupid people say I have lost the initiative. They are living on the planet Mars or in any place other than Argentina," he said. It was the President's first statement to the press since he returned to Argentina on Tuesday evening after a week long visit to Asia. In his absence, speculation surrounding the delay of Congressional passage of the government's economic measures and changes to the plans has mounted. The budget deficit, which the measures aim to narrow, "will not reach two percent of gross domestic product," said Menem. "That is not worrying and we will improve it, because that is what the measures are for."   President Menem also said that Argentine unemployment will "not rise above 12 percent," and promised that the jobless rate will fall, referring to a recent private sector study that argued unemployment was much lower than official estimates. The government's measures, pending passage by Congress, include the most recent proposals of tax hikes on gasoline and cuts in family benefits and the abolition of tax on shopping vouchers given to more than a million workers as part of their pay packet. On Wednesday, the budget and finance committee of the lower house of Congress approved the gasoline tax hikes. But the committee failed to give the thumbs up to the government's proposal to give the central government a larger share of the income from the taxes than provincial governments. -- Axel Bugge, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 54 1 3180668
