Dutch-Belgian financial group Fortis reported a 21 percent rise in first-half net profits Thursday that were mainly driven by a strong rise in earnings from banking. The group's overall net profit rose to 366 million European currency units ($466 million) from 302 million ($398 million). First-half operating profit for the group's banking business rose 27 percent to 258 million ECU ($385 million) while operating profits from insurance rose 14 percent to 348 million ECU ($443 million). Fortis -- jointly owned by Fortis AMEV of the Netherlands and Fortis AG of Belgium -- said the rise in profits was mainly attributable to operations in its twin home markets. With the exception of accident and health insurance, all sectors in which Fortis operates contributed to the profit rise. Fortis said the sharp rise in banking profits was partly due to relatively low banking profits in the first half of 1995. It said that in the second half of this year it did not expect to equal the exceptionally high banking profits achieved in the same period of 1995. But it added that its insurance business would post a further increase in profits. The company said it wanted to expand its businesses worldwide through both acquisition and organic growth, particularly in the life insurance and investment sectors. "We do have an external growth strategy and we want to build another strong base in Europe; we want to expand in the U.S. and in the longer term we would like to build a position in Asia as well," director Saskia van Opijnen said. Fortis said it expected net profit for the whole of 1996 to rise at least 10 percent while the two parent companies expect full-year earnings per share to rise at least seven percent.
