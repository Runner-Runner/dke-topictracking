The Brussels bourse finished lower on Thursday, in line with other European markets and the Dow Jones, which stood 40 points down as Brussels closed. The Dow was hit by strong U.S. July home sales and an upward revision to second quarter U.S. GDP growth, which sent the U.S. 30-year bond's yield above the key seven percent level. Dealers said Friday's price action would depend strongly on the Dow's close and the direction of interest rates and the dollar, as the corporate earnings publication does not come on stream until mid-September.   The Bel-20 index of leading shares closed 13.02 points or 0.75 percent lower at 1,730.03. Total volume in Belgian shares was worth 2.47 billion francs. Insurer Fortis AG ended 1.6 percent lower the after release of first-half earnings. Net profit rose to 6.64 billion francs, from 5.39 billion last year. Dealers said the fall was due to profit taking. "The results were in line with expectations," one dealer said. Holding company Gevaert and building sector stock Deceuninck closed 2.8 and 1.5 percent higher at 2,040 and 4,180 francs respectively ahead of publication of results on Friday. -- Geert De Clercq, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6813, Fax +32 2 230 7710
