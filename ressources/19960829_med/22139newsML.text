Washington Mutual Inc said Thursday that William Longbrake will return to the company as chief financial officer after a year and a half with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The company said its current chief financial officer, Thomas Kappock, has resigned and accepted a position as group executive vice president of operations and administration for Visa International in San Francisco.   Company executives anticipate Longbrake will rejoin Washington Mutual in early October. As part of the transition, company controller Douglas Wisdorf will assume expanded responsibilities as deputy chief financial officer, reporting to Longbrake. Longbrake, 53, served as Washington Mutual's chief financial officer from 1982 to 1995 before leaving to become chief financial officer and deputy to the chairman for finance at the FDIC, where he previously had served in several positions. Longbrake rejoins the financial services company as it prepares an aggressive expansion into California through the pending acquisition of American Savings Bank. Kappock joined Washington Mutual in August 1995 after 23 years with Honolulu-based Bancorp Hawaii Inc. In his new position, he will head a newly organized division at Visa that includes applications development and processing and network services. 			     -- Seattle bureau 206-386-4848
