The Chinese currency is facing pressure to appreciate, not to depreciate, a senior Chinese monetary official said on Thursday. Zhou Xiaochuan, director-general of China's State Administration of Exchange Control, made the comment when asked to respond to concerns that the yuan would fall after the country's recent cuts in interest rates. China's falling inflation -- which spurred the interest rate cut -- should buoy the yuan, Zhou told a news conference. "A country's currency stability depends to a great extent on the inflation rate. High inflation means currency depreciation," he said. "When inflation is low or steady, the currency is steady." China's retail price inflation was 5.8 percent in July year-on-year, versus 7.1 percent for the six months of 1996. Zhou said the yuan was under obvious pressure to appreciate this year. It stood at 8.3066 against the U.S. dollar on the Shanghai interbank foreign exchange market on Thursday, versus 8.3180 at the beginning of the year. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6590
