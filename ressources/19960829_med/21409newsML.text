The Supreme Court of Costa Rica temporarily has lifted a ban on imports of all Volkswagen A.G. products that a lower court imposed as part of a civil suit against the German car-maker. "The prohibition (of Volkswagen imports) is suspended until the Constitutional Court resolves the lawsuit," court spokesman Fabian Barrantes told Reuters. A lower court on Tuesday barred all Volkswagen cars, parts and machinery from entering Costa Rica until the company paid a $1 million deposit in a civil case in which Volkswagen is being sued by its longtime former sales representative who was replaced by another agent. A Volkswagen representaive here said the company has 8,000 to 10,000 cars on the road with projected sales of 300 new cars for 1997.    --Jose Loria, San Jose bureau, (506) 224-2949
