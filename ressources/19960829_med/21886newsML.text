Securities Corp of Iowa (SCI) said it forecast a U.S. corn crop of 8.82 billion bushels this year and soybean production of 2.16 billion. SCI's forecast was above the U.S. Department of Agriculture's estimate earlier this month for corn output of 8.69 billion bushels but below USDA's soybean production estimate of 2.30 billion. USDA is due to revise its forecast on September 11. Last year the U.S. corn crop totalled 7.37 billion bushels and soybean production was 2.15 billion. --Chicago newsdesk 312-408 8720
