Average commitment rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 8.09 percent in the week ending August 30 from 7.93 percent in the previous week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp said Thursday. Freddie Mac said 15-year loans also rose, to an average 7.60 percent from 7.45 percent last week. Adjustable-rate mortgages inched down to 5.75 percent from 5.79 percent last week. A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 7.76 percent, the 15-year 7.27 percent, and the ARM 5.86 percent.   Freddie Mac said lenders charged an average 1.7 percent in fees and points on 30- and 15-year loans, both unchanged from last week. They charged 1.4 percent on the ARM, also unchanged from the previous week. "Continued vigor in the economy, as evidenced by the upward revision to the GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate and strength in new home sales in July, helped to push interest rates higher this past week," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist. "Still, with 30-year rates around eight percent, consumer confidence up and strong economic growth, home sales should continue at a good pace," he said. The Commerce Department on Thursday revised U.S. second quarter GDP growth to a 4.8 percent annual rate from a previously reported 4.2 percent. The department also said U.S. July new home sales rose 7.9 percent after falling 1.8 percent in June. The Conference Board, a private business research organization, on Tuesday said the U.S. August Consumer Confidence Index rose to a six-year high of 109.4, up from 107.0 in July.
