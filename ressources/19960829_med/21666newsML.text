Israeli prison officials took jailed Islamic militant Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to hospital on Thursday after a deterioration in his health, security sources said. The 60-year-old Yassin, jailed by Israel since 1989, is serving a life sentence for ordering attacks by Hamas guerrillas against Israeli targets. The ailing Moslem cleric is the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist Hamas group which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks aimed at wrecking Israel-PLO peace deals. Prison officials could not be reached for comment. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has demanded that Israel release Yassin -- who is confined to a wheelchair -- on humanitarian grounds. An Israeli minister said last month after the Jewish state recovered the body of an Israeli soldier abducted by Hamas seven years ago that Israel would consider freeing Yassin.
