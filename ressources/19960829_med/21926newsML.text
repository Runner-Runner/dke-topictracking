Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) said on Thursday the vice president of its cargo division, Einar Longva, would step down from his post on November 1 and be replaced by SAS' Peter Gronlund. Longva would take up the post as managing director of Jetpack, a courier cargo service company owned by SAS, SAS spokeswoman Eva Hjalmer told Reuters. Gronlund, former vice president of space control services in Copenhagen for SAS, would move to SAS Cargo on September 1, but will not become the unit's vice president until November 1 when he completed a training period. -- Paul de Bendern, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1003
