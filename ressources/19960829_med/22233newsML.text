The Federal Aviation Administration Thursday said it returned Valujet Inc's operating certificate but that the airline must get further government approvals before being allowed to offer service. "This action will permit Valuejet to resume operations at a future date if the airline is found to be managerially and financially fit by the Department of Transportation, which today issued a tentative finding of Valujet's economic fitness," the FAA said in a statement.   The approval is the result of an intensive FAA review of Valujet's revised maintenance and operations programs, as well as the airline's management capacity and organizational structure, the agency said. The FAA said Valujet will be operating as a smaller airline upon returning to service, starting up with nine aircraft and adding up to six more in the days following.
