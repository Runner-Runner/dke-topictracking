Approximately 30 children were treated for heat-related problems Thursday at several hospitals in northeast Kansas after their school was evacuated when a construction worker ruptured a natural gas line. Law enforcement authorities initially said the children had been overcome by natural gas fumes, but school officials and spokeswomen at several hospitals later confirmed most of the children were suffering from heat-related discomfort. "They were let out (of school) when the gas leak was discovered, and a lot of them stayed outside and started fainting" because of the heat, said a spokeswoman at Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Lawrence, Kansas, where seven children were treated and released. A spokeswoman at Providence Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas, said its emergency room workers had treated and released 13 children. She said one girl was still under observation but her condition was not serious. The mixture of hot temperatures and high humidity across northeast Kansas produced extreme heat stress conditions Thursday, according to Weather Express, a Nebraska-based weather forecasting company.
