CNBC, the financial cable television channel, said on Thursday that an internal review found no basis to conclude that commentator Dan Dorfman, whose daily reports often move stock prices, has violated any law or internal policy. CNBC, a unit of General Electric Co, retained the law firm of Shearman and Sterling to review allegations that Dorfman benefited from stock tips and received favors from companies for mentioning stocks, the channel said. Dorfman is expected to return to CNBC after completing therapy for a mild stroke he suffered in May, the network said.   The law firm found no patterns of suspicious trading prior to any of Dorfman's reports, CNBC said. Dorfman supplied copies of records for securities accounts, bank accounts and tax returns, CNBC said. CNBC said the law firm did not have the investigative powers of the federal government, such as subpoenas and the ability to identify who conducted stock trades, and the company would take any other information into consideration. Dorfman continued working for CNBC until his stroke. A Business Week report in October 1995 reported that the U.S. Attorney's office was investigating Dorfman and his relationship with Donald Kessler, a stock promoter and a regularly quoted source in Dorfman's reports. The report also said the officials were investigating insider trading charges. Dorfman denied any wrongdoing when the report was issued, but Money Magazine gave him a leave of absence in October, before dismissing him, to address the allegations in the Business Week article. Money Magazine terminated Dorfman's employment as a columnist in January because Dorfman refused to reveal his market sources to the magazine. Dorfman called the magazine's demands unacceptable.
