-- Salomon Brothers analyst Ivy Schneider said she downgraded Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp to buy from strong buy and cut her earnings estimate on the company. -- In a research note, she said she cut her 1996 estimate to $4.70 a share from $4.80, and cut her 1997 view to $5.30 from $5.60.   -- "Although Owens-Corning reported high single-digit year-over-year increases in July sales of roofing and insulation, composites continue to exhibit the weakness that was apparent in the second quarter," Schneider said. "This has led to a mix shift from reinforcements to less expensive yarn, which has caused us to lower both our top line and our margin assumptions." -- She said, however, that weakness "may be partially offset by a lower tax rate as the company's accountants continue to search for deductions." -- Shares were down 1/2 at 36-1/2.
