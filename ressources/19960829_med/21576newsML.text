China's construction minister has warned that a chronic shortage of urban housing is an urgent problem threatening to throw its society into chaos. "The construction of urban dwellings is not just a housing problem, it also is closely related to the maintaining of social order," the Xinhua news agency quoted Minister of Construction Hou Jie as saying. "Without enough houses...society will face potential disorder," Hou said. Although many people had enough savings to buy homes and the cost of construction raw materials had fallen drastically in the past few years, there was a huge housing shortage in China's crowded cities, Hou said. Beijing would devote more funds and pass favourable policies to try to spur construction for medium and low-income residents, he said. Hou said his ministry would work with the State Planning Commission and the central bank to remove official barriers to buying and selling homes. Almost all housing in China's cities is assigned and subsidised by the state, and most residents are restricted from selling their homes. China has pledged to build 1.3 billion sq m (14.0 billion sq ft) of housing in urban areas during the next five years in a bid to raise the average per capita living space to 9.0 sq m (97 sq ft) from 7.9 sq m (85 sq ft) in 1995.
