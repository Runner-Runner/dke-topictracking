ARA bunkers prices rose on Thursday as end-user demand remained high, while gas oil and diesel prices soared, dealers said. Rotterdam 380 CST traded about $1 a tonne higher at between $102 and $103 fob. The moderate price surprised some as demand was good, at around 15-20,000 tonnes, and barge market prices for September were higher than late August. Few, however, were surprised at the pick-up in demand which had come despite the price rise. "The demand has been lousy for three weeks or so, so the users have been forced to buy now," one dealer said. Hamburg prices rose about $1/$2 a tonne. Traders said cargo prices were strong. Business was likewise healthy with many enquiries coming in and buyers keenly comparing with Rotterdam prices, dealers said. Mediterranean activity was slower which many dealers attributed to the firmer tone of fuel oil in northwest Europe. Dealers in Spain, Italy and Greece all said demand remained slow. Only in France were dealers prepared to describe demand as acceptable. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 5000, Fax +31 20 5040
