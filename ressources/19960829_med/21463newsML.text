Two Brazilian senators have struck a deal over a bill allowing the Central Bank to buy back Brady bonds and swap them for sovereigns and have set no limit on the operations, officials said. An aide to Senator Vilson Kleinubing said he and Senator Roberto Requiao had reached a compromise, substituting Requiao's demand for a $5.0 billion limit on buyback and debt swap operations for strict Congressional oversight. After three months of bickering, the rehashed draft bill is now likely to be put to a vote in the Senate Economic Affairs Commitee on September 10.
