A group including Genesis Financial Partners L.P. said Thursday it plans to ask shareholders of First Keystone Financial Corp to seek board action to seek a sale or merger of First Keystone. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it advised First Keystone in an August 20 letter that it intends to introduce a shareholder resolution to that effect at the company's annual meeting this year. The group said the resolution would call for the board to "immediately take the necessary steps to achieve a sale, merger or other acquisition (not including a merger of equals)" of First Keystone as soon as possible on terms that would maximize shareholder value. The group, which holds a 5.9 percent stake in First Keystone, said it is also considering submitting additional proposals as well as potentially nominating an alternative or partial slate of director nominees, but no final decision has been made on the matter.
