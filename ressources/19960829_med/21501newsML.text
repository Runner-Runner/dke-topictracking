Brazilians would re-elect President Fernando Henrique Cardoso by a wide margin if a national election were held today, according to a government sponsored poll published on Thursday. Some 41 percent of Brazilians surveyed by pollsters MCI/Ibope at the request of Cardoso's office said they would vote for the president. The closest runner-up, Worker Party leader Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva, trailed with 18 percent. Lula was the runner-up in Brazil's 1994 presidential election that put Cardoso in office. The poll, published in Brazilian newspapers, surveyed 3,000 people between August 20-26. It did not provide a margin of error. The poll said former president Jose Sarney and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf would tie for third place with 11 percent of the vote. Itamar Franco, Cardoso's predecessor who is reportedly eyeing another run for the presidency, would take five percent of the vote. Cardoso, who is nearly halfway through a four-year term, is actively seeking congressional support for a constitutional amendment to allow him to serve a second term in office. Brazil is scheduled to hold presidential elections in October 1998.
