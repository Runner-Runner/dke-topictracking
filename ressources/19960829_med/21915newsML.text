Danish shipping and shipbuilding group J.Lauritzen said on Thursday that it would be forced to end ship production at its loss-making Danyard unit in 1998 unless there was a sharp change in market conditions. Announcing a group loss of 199 million crowns for the first half of 1996 it estimated that it would lose at least one billion crowns over the course of 3-4 years on a contract to build seven chemical tankers due for completion in early 1998. "Despite a series of production improvements Danyard's management has not succeeded in making the building of these ships viable," a Lauritzen statement said. Lauritzen, which has warned before that Danyard may have to close, estimated a 1996 full-year group loss of 300 million crowns. "The loss can be solely attributed to Danyard," it said. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650
