Full House Resorts Inc, which earlier reported a narrowed second-quarter loss, said it expects improvement in its operating results due to new sources of revenue coming from joint venture operations. Earlier, Full House said it had a loss of $297,504, or $0.03 a share, compared to a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.27 a share, in the second quarter of last year. Results for the first half of 1996 do not include the impact of Midway Slots and Racebook at Delaware's Harrington Raceway which opened on August 20, the company said. The Midway Slots facility has 500 gaming devices and a 150-seat simulcast parlor and racebook with individual television screens for players. "Results from this gaming and entertainment facility have exceeded company projections within the first week of operations," said Full House Resorts chairman and chief executive Allen Paulson. "With new sources of revenue coming from our joint venture operations, the Company anticipates continued improvement in its operating results," he said. -- Reuter Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787
