Despite weakness in bond and futures markets, spreads on U.S. swaps remain at historically tight levels, dealers said. Following Treasury Department's auction of two and five-year notes, spreads contracted slightly. Spreads had moved out a few basis points as some firms anticipated repo tightness on the new notes, opening a window for the popular cost of carry trade. But after the auctions, repo scarceness failed to develop and spreads came back in.   "There wasn't the scramble for notes some people anticipated," one dealer said. "Those trades are totally off now." Spreads on two-year LIBOR swaps were quoted at 17 basis points bid, 19 basis points offered, in about one basis point since the auctions. On three-year swaps, spreads were quoted at 20 basis points bid, 22 basis points offered. Spreads on five-year swaps were quoted at 24 to 25 basis points bid, 27 basis points offered, about two basis points tighter than before the auction.   At the longer end, potential swappping off Eurobond issuance kept spreads tight, traders said. Several large dollar-denominated Eurobond issues could be priced in early September, including a $500 million, 10-year bond from Kansai Electric Power. Spreads on 10-year LIBOR swaps were quoted at 34 basis points bid, 36 basis points offered, about one basis point tighter over the past few days. --202-898-8312
