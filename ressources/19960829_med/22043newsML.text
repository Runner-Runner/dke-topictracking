British Airways (BA) said on Thursday it had entered a marketing partnership in frequent flyer programmes with a leading Indian private airline, Jet Airways. Indian residents in BA's Executive Club programme can get credit for free travel across India on Jet Airways and Jet's "Privilege Programme" customers can get similar benefits for international travel with BA, it said in a statement. The partnership would take effect from November, BA said. "Jet Airways is a major player in India. It is a quality airline," Kevin Steele, British Airways' general manager for South Asia, told a news conference in the Indian capital. "The new partnership does not involve exchange of equity or other forms of cross-shareholding. British Airways and Jet Airways remain separate entities, retaining their own identities and brands," the statement said. Officials from both airlines said there was no financial exchange involved in the agreement, which also does not form any exclusive arrangement that would bar marketing partnerships with other airlines. But they said the partnership with Jet Airways could be upgraded sometime in the future. "Of course, we have plans," Steele said, but added that their outcome would depend on further talks between the two airlines and approvals from the Indian government. "We are very cost conscious. And we are looking at a long-term relationship," said Naresh Goyal, chairman of Jet Airways. Steele said the partnership augured well for British Airways because India's internal air traffic was growing at a rate of between 10 and 15 percent while West-bound travel from India was growing at the rate of 10 to 12 percent. "I am extremely bullish about what's happening in India," Steele said. --New Delhi newsroom, +91-11-3012024
