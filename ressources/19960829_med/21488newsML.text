Chilean export income should slip this year to $15.5 billion from $16.4 billion in 1995, a drop of about 5.1 percent, the private National Exporters Corporation. It attributed the drop to lower prices, particularly on paper pulp and some fish products such as salmon. The slump in international prices on Chile's main export products is expected to last through the second half of the year, said the association in a statement.   Exports in the first half of this year totalled $8.09 billion, with a trade surplus of $367 million, the Central Bank reported. --Roger Atwood, Santiago newsroom +56-2-699-5595 x211
