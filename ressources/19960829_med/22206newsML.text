U.S. spot LPG prices were slightly higher to unchanged in late trade on Thursday, supported by bullish stock data for propane and strong NYMEX crude oil futures, traders said. In the Gulf Coast hub of Mont Belvieu, Texas, propane held on to its one cent intraday gain at between 41.50 cents and 41.75 cents a gallon. Conway, Kansas, hub material rose a quarter cent to 40.00/40.25 cents, after gaining one cent at midday. Parcels for 40.13 cents were sold. For Belvieu, many traders quoted September prices. "The APIs especially for propane is what really drove this market up today," said one Midwest trader. The American Petroleum Institute report late Wednesday registered a mere 200,000 barrel build for the Gulf Coast in July to a current total of 12.3 million barrels, said traders. Total U.S. stocks gained 7.2 million barrels for the month to a current 46.97 million barrel level. NYMEX October crude oil futures ended up 44 cents at $22.15 a barrel, lending support for the market. -- Laney Salisbury, New York Energy Desk +1 212 859-1631
