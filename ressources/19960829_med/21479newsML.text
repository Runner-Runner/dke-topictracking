Guerrilla violence in two Mexican states rattled the country's currency markets on Thursday, leading dealers to take dollar positions at least in the short term and causing the same-day peso to close weaker. The same-day peso lost two centavos to close at 7.5040/7.5070. The benchmark 48-hour or spot peso was off 2.7 centavos to 7.5235/7.5270, and the 24-hour peso was losing 1.7 centavos to 7.5070/7.5120. "People are covering their short dollar positions," one peso trader said. "They don't want any surprises with the guerrillas or with the (president's state of the nation) report this weekend." The peso also was affected by higher-than-expected growth in U.S. gross domestic product, which sent yields rising on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. "The noise over the confrontations has hit the market, but not any more than the rise in the long-bond yield," one dealer said. --Alexis Quinones, Mexico City newsroom, (525) 728-9555
