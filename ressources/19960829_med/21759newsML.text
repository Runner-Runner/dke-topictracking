An unrepentant and abusive Liam Gallagher arrived in Chicago on Thursday to rejoin his touring bandmates in "Oasis", denying speculation that he was thinking of leaving the hugely successful British rock group. Gallagher, the group's lead singer, swore at reporters who asked why he was late in joining the three-week tour, which began on Tuesday in Chicago with his brother Noel filling in. Many fans asked for refunds when Liam failed to show up. He said he was late because he had been suffering from a sore throat and was busy house-hunting. Gallagher skipped the band's departure from London's Heathrow Airport on Monday, saying he had "problems at home." The band also performed without him on Aug. 23 on an "Unplugged" show from London's Royal Festival Hall broadcast on Music Television (MTV). Upon arriving in Chicago, Gallagher swore repeatedly when asked if his absence was an insult to fans, and said his priority was himself, not his fans nor anyone else. The band was scheduled to perform in Auburn Hills, Michigan, outside Detroit on Friday. The 15,000-seat venue, The Palace, was not sold out, but a promoter said a walk-up crowd could fill the remaining seats. The notorious Gallagher brothers from Manchester have stormed music charts worldwide with a string of electrifying hits including "Wonderwall", "Don't Look Back in Anger", and "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?".
