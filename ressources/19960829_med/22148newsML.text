Monterey Pasta Co said it anticipates continuing losses for its third quarter ending September 30, based on preliminary results for July and August. It said the expected losses are due to lower-than-anticipated sales, higher-than-anticipated returns and allowances, and certain one-time charges that increased the cost of goods sold. President and chief executive officer Ned Dean said in a statement that the company is re-evaluating its strategy of dramatically expanding into new retail markets, in view of the high return rates and low sales in certain markets. "We remain confident of the quality of our products and the company's potential to be profitable but we cannot continue to invest in markets that have turned out to be unprofitable," he said.
