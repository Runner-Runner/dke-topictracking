President Clinton will propose increasing the capital gains exemption on profits from the sale of a home and extending the tax break to all Americans, the White House said on Thursday. Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling said that under the plan, the current $125,000 one-time exemption would be raised to $500,000 for joint filers, and to $250,000 for single taxpayers. Every home-seller would be eligible instead of just those 55 and older as current law provides.
