Brazil's Parana state still expects its 1996 wheat crop to be close to double that of 1995 despite the effects of a three-month long dry spell, according to the state agricultural secretariat. "We're now expecting a 1996 crop of 1.75 to 1.85 million tonnes, on a planted area of 1.01 million hectares," a secretariat officer said. Brazil's biggest wheat producing state, in 1995 Parana harvested 960,000 tonnes on a planted area of 579,000 hectares. The biggest wheat crop so far recorded in the state was of 3.25 million tonnes, in 1988, she said.   The atypical dry spell has however forced a reduction in Parana's 1996 crop estimate from the 1.84 to 2.04 million tonnes foreseen at the start of planting in April. "Harvest expectations for northern Parana are down 36 percent from April, to 369,000 tonnes," the officer said. Wheat harvesting started in Parana state around two weeks ago and so far seven percent of the crop has been brought in, she said.   There has been no rain for at least three months in parts of the north and northwest of Parana, including the wheat-growing areas of Cornelio Procopio and Jacarezinho, the officer said. There is also no sign of the weather normalising, she said. The secretariat has not so far estimated the losses producers may suffer due to the drought, although market sources have put this at around $40 million.   Producers in Parana state were encouraged to plant a larger area this year because of a spate of favorable international market prices,  the  agricultural secretariat said. However, domestic wheat prices have now started to plummet with the start of the harvest. Producer prices were yesterday $11.28 per 60-kilo bag in the north of Parana, down from $14 in July, the officer said. Independent analyst Safras e Mercado quoted wheat producer prices in Parana state at around $180-190 a tonne fob, down from $280 a month ago but higher than the $160 of a year ago.   "As well as the coming on the market of Brazil's harvest, prices are being pressured by the large crop in Argentina," Safras' wheat analyst Gil Barabach said. Rio Grande do Sul, another major wheat producing state, should also have a significantly bigger crop this year, said state cooperatives federation Fecotrigo. "We expect to produce 950,000 tonnes of wheat in 1996, on a planted area of 550,000 hectares, with average productivity of 1,700 kg per hectare," said Fecotrigo analyst Paul Marie Oorts.   Climatic conditions are currently favorable and the harvest should begin in late October, he said. In 1995 Rio Grande do Sul produced 336,000 tonnes of wheat from 270,000 hectares and with an average productivity of 1,244 kg per hectare, Oorts said. Brazil's overall wheat harvest should be some 2.7 million tonnes this year, up from 1.52 million in 1995, the Parana agricultural secretariat said. The planted area has grown to 1.6 million hectares, from 1995's 985,300 hectares.   Safras' Barabach  said Brazil's total wheat consumption is expected to remain stable in 1996 at 8.3 million tonnes, with imports at 5.5 million tonnes. Stocks held are sufficient only for one month's consumption, he said. -- Diana Kinch, Rio de Janeiro newsroom 5521 5074151
