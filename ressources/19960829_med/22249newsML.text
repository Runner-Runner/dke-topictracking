President Bill Clinton plans on Thursday to propose extending the home sellers capital gains tax exemption, White House aide Gene Sperling told reporters. Under current law, people over the age of 55 can claim a one-time tax exclusion of $125,000 on the sale of a home. Sperling said Clinton's proposal would eliminate the age limit and would increase the tax exclusion to $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for a couple filing their income taxes jointly.
