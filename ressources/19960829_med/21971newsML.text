Talks were continuing at the European Union's grain panel as officials were discussing a possible increase in the quota of German intervention barley available for export, European grain industry sources said.   Last Thursday the European Union had informally offered to open 150,000 tonnes of extra German intervention barley but took no decision pending confirmation of a large barley purchase by Saudi Arabia and greater clarity over prices. Traders had been pressing for an increase of 300,000 tonnes to help cover the Saudi purchase. But EU officials said last week it was too early to take a decision. Saudi Arabia provisionally bought 800,000 tonnes of optional barley on August 21, traders have said. Grain traders and officials said this week the Saudis may reduce the purchase to 600,000 tonnes. --Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432
