Venezuela hopes to make a preliminary register of its forthcoming issue of telephone company CANTV shares on U.S. capital markets in September, CANTV President Gustavo Roosen said Thursday. Roosen told a news conference the issue of the government's 49 percent stake in the company will be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Venezuelan Shares Commission (CNV) in the second week of September. "After that we go on to marketing the company which is supposed to happen from the third week of October," he said. The Venezuelan government hopes to make the global issue of its CANTV stake in the second week of November. U.S. investment banks Lehman Brothers and SBC Warburg are co- leaders of the global issue while local brokerages Merinvest and Valores Santander - a unit of Spain's Banco Santander - are managing the placement of shares on the local market. Sources close to the offering have told Reuters the government aims to place about 10 percent of the 49 percent on Venezuelan capital markets. Roosen said the privatization process had been given a boost by the government's recent decision to pay off outstanding bills of about 24 billion bolivars ($50 million) with CANTV. "Last week they paid off six billion bolivars and we hope they will pay off some more this week," he said. CANTV was partially privatized in 1991 when the VenWorld consortium led by GTE Corp bought a 40 percent stake. Workers bought another 11 percent of the company. The government has said it plans to offer workers a further nine percent of the company as part of this year's sell-off. The VenWorld consortium is led by GTE Corp with a 51 percent stake. Local utility Electricidad de Caracas holds 16 percent,  Telefonica de Espana 16 percent, local bank Banco Mercantil 12 percent and AT&T five percent. -- Ana Isabel Martinez, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
