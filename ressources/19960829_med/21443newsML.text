Argentina's Agriculture Secretariat has reduced its estimate of final wheat sowing to 6.83 million hectares, it said Thursday in its weekly crop report, dated August 23. Last week its estimate was 6.9 million hectares. Some 97.5 percent of wheat has already been sown. Wheat planted in the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa is in good state. But drought further north meant that sowing finished early in Cordoba, Entre Rios and Santa Fe, where much wheat needs rain soon. A large part of wheat in these areas is developing slowly and lacks color.   Intended total planting (thousands of hectares) and the percentage already sown (year-earlier in brackets). Harvest levels (thousands of hectares) and as a percentage of planted area, (year-earlier in brackets).
