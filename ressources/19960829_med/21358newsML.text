The Polish unit of Italy's Fiat Spa got a permit, required by a recent regulation, to import duty-free parts for car assembly and other firms should receive such permits soon, the foreign trade ministry spokesman said. "The first permit was granted on Wednesday to Fiat. We've received two other applications which are being analysed...and if they meet the requirements they will be accepted," Zbigniew Ostrowski told a news conference. Early last week, the government adopted a regulation obliging auto firms to secure a permit from the foreign trade ministry to import duty-free parts for assembly as of August 24. The regulation, which was not made immediately available to the media, replaced the previous one which automatically exempted any company from car parts duty if it assembled more than 1,000 units annually. It surprised car makers, threatening with a temporary halt of production for those who found themselves with small stocks of car parts. The regulation was designed by the industry ministry to limit small assembly plants run by companies, which want to profit on Poland's booming car market without investing much. Foreign Trade Minister Jacek Buchacz, also present, said the ministry would make sure car assembly was not halted. "I think there is no danger of a sudden halt in car assembling in Poland. The situation is under control," he said. But Daewoo-FSO, a unit of South Korea's Daewoo Corp told Reuters the firm had enough car parts in stock to continue car assembly in the next few days but after that, unless granted a permission, the factory would to be idled. "If we don't receive the permission in the next few days a stoppage will be inevitable," she said, adding that the company has applied for the permit. The regulation also blocked the launch of the assembly of Hyundai cars by a joint venture between Universal SA and South Korea's Hyundai, Universal spokesman said on Wednesday. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
