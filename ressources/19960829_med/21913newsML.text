Danish shipping and shipbuilding group J. Lauritzen said on Thursday that its loss-making Danyard shipyard had pushed the group deeper into the red and would probably close in 1998. A Lauritzen statement said that group losses rose to 199 million crowns in the first half of 1996 from a revised 39 million loss in the same period last year and it forecast a full-year group loss of 300 million crowns. "The loss can be solely attributed to Danyard," it said in a statement, adding that its DFDS ferries, J.Lauritzen transport and Aalborg Industries units were all doing well.   Announcing its first-half results, delayed for 24 hours while the board discussed them, Lauritzen blamed Danyard's woes on market conditions, particularly unfavourable dollar exchange rates against the strong Danish crown. It estimated that it would lose at least one billion crowns over the course of 3-4 years on a contract to build seven chemical tankers due for completion in early 1998. "Despite...production improvements, Danyard's management has not succeeded in making the building of these ships viable," it said, adding that, unless conditions changed, Danyard would close when the last of the ships was finished.   Lauritzen, which has warned before that Danyard may have to close, said that DFDS first-half profits rose to 61 million crowns from a half-year 1995 loss of 25 million. J. Lauritzen's result was 70 million compared with 46 million and Aalborg Industries chalked up a 16 million crown profit compared with 2.5 million during the same period last year. It said that long-serving group chairman Karsten Laursen was leaving for health reasons and would be replaced by Michael Christiansen, managing director of the Danish Royal Theatre. It also said its senior management structure would be rearranged so that directors of the group holding company no longer also sat on the boards of subsidiaries. -- Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650
