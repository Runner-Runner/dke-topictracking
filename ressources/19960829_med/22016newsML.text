Pakistan's interbank money rates slipped at the close on Thursday on surplus funds left in the system even after settlement of an auction of federal Investment bonds, dealers said. They said rates were likely to firm on Sunday when the State (central) Bank of Pakistan has announced that it will conduct a special open market operation. Overnight funding rates opened at 13 percent amid outflow of 1.38 billion rupees to settle the auction but came down to 2.50 percent near close due to excess liquidity, one dealer said. -- Ovais Subhani 9221-5685192
