The drawdown across the barrel in Singapore oil products on Thursday kept most products firm but failed to support jet fuel prices, traders said. Jet fuel was under pressure with a U.S trader offering 100,000 barrels lifting September 13-17 aggressively at $28.60, lower than Wednesday's offer of $29.10. The same trader was also looking to swap a 300,000 barrels jet fuel cargo for gasoil at a $3.00 premium. Traders said supplies were ample with high stocks reported in Guam while more unplaced MidEast cargoes were heading to Singapore for storage, in spite of China buying up to 100,000 tonnes of jet for arrival in the fourth quarter.   Gas oil firmed on a higher IPE open. But traders were skeptical of further price hikes as current levels are dampening Chinese demand which earlier this week bought up to 90,000 tonnes for early September below $200 a tonne cost-and-freight. Light distillates fell by 168,000 barrels to their lowest level of 4.711 million barrels in at least 20 months. "It is not surprising considering Singapore's gasoline is the cheapest in the world and cargoes have been moving out," a trader said. But prices only edged up with a bid for a 92-octane unleaded cargo lifting September 14-23 from morning, finally traded at $20.50 at market close, just 10 cents higher from Wednesday's deal level. The shutdown of Yukong's 30,000 barrels-per-day residue desulphuriser until September 1 will not provide any additional September fuel oil supplies, the refiner said. Fuel oil prices rose, tracking paper levels amid bullish sentiments triggered by the fall in stocks. Traders described the fall of 984,000 barrels in residues to 9.07 million barrels as "significant". A major offered 20,000 tonnes of 180 cst lifting September 26-30 at $109 per tonne, with a trader bidding at $105, marginally higher than Wednesday's bid at $104.50. Singapore's September paper was quoted at $106.00/$107.00 firmer from its Wednesday's
