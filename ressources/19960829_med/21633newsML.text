Singapore's Asia Pacific Breweries will soon start producing its Tiger beer and ABC Stout at a new $46 million brewery in Cambodia, a senior company official said. "We expect to start commercial production by mid-October, currently we are testing all the machines and equipment," a manager of the Cambodian Brewery Ltd, the Singaporean company's joint venture, said late on Wednesday. He said the company, encouraged by economic growth in Cambodia, had decided to raise its annual output targets to 26 million hectare litres from 17 million hectare litres. Asia Pacific Breweries holds an 80 percent stake in Cambodian Brewery Ltd, with the rest held by local company Progress Import Export. The brewery contract was signed in 1994 and construction of the plant began in April 1995. The brewery is one of the biggest foreign investment projects in Cambodia since a 1991 peace accord.
