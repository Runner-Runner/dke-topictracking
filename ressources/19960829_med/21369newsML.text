Ceska Sporitelna a.s., the Czech Republic's largest savings bank, expects net profit for 1996 to total 2.1 billion crowns, while gross profit will hit "at least" 6.1 billion, bank CEO Jaroslav Klapal said on Thursday. Klapal told a news conference that he expected the bank would pay a higher dividend in 1996 than its five crown per share dividend for last year.   "Gross profit, before the creation of reserves and payment of taxes could be slightly above 6.1 billion crowns," Klapal said. "We are counting on dividends for this year being higher than that of last year." Sporitelna's 1995 after-tax profit, calculated according to Czech accounting standards, plummetted to 263 million crowns from a previous 980 million crowns after the bank provisioned heavily for risky loans. The bank's 1995 gross profit was 9.17 billion crowns but the bank assigned almost an identical sum, 9.13 billion, to its reserves covering "classified" loans -- those whose likelihood of recovery ranges from doubtful to hopeless. Klapal did not say whether his forecasts were calculated according to Czech or international accounting standards, which vary mainly in terms of allowable write-offs and depreciation costs.   Sporitelna, which is 45 percent state-owned, has been plagued by bad debts since soon after the 1989 fall of communism. At the time, the government put pressure on most Czech banks to lend to the new class of entrepreneurs. Since then risk assessment has been tightened up as Czech banking expertise has improved. -- Radek Narovec, Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003
