Pamida Holdings Corp said Thursday its comparable-store sales for the second quarter ended July 28 declined 4.8 percent and fell 2.7 percent for the fiscal year to date. It said comparable-store sales for the quarter were held back by slowed warehouse distributions to stores during the installation of a new warehouse management software system and the fact that last year's sales amount included low-margin clearance sales, which did not reoccur this year. During the second quarter, Pamida opened five new stores, two of which replaced existing units. An additional store was opened in August, increasing Pamida's current store count to 147. Three more stores are scheduled to open prior to Thanksgiving. 	   -- Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787
