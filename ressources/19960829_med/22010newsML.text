The Afghan government has sent hundreds of troops to the strategic town of Sarobi to defend it against possible attack from the Islamic Taleban militia, a Pakistan-based news agency said on Thursday. The Afghan Islamic Press quoted witnesses as saying that hundreds of fighters loyal to Prime Minister Gulbaddin Hekmatyar had arrived in Sarobi, about 60 km (37 miles) east of Kabul on the main highway to Jalalabad, on Wednesday. Sarobi has long been a stronghold of Hekmatyar, but Taleban advances against his Hezb-i-Islami in Paktiya province this month prompted fears that it might be the Islamic militia's next target. The Taleban's success in Paktiya also brought its fighters close to territory controlled by neutral factions grouped in the Nangarhar provincial shura (council) based in Jalalabad. A local newspaper quoted Nangarhar governor Haji Abdul Qadeer on Thursday as saying the council's forces would defend its borders, without taking sides in the conflict between President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government and the Taleban. Afghan sources in Jalalabad said the shura had sent 1,000 troops and 40 tanks to defend Nangarhar's western border.
