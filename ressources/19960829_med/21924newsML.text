Spitzbergen, the Arctic island where a Russian airliner crashed on Thursday, lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet. Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people and hundreds of roaming polar bears, Spitzbergen sees the sun for 24 hours a day during its short summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness for much of the winter. Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there. Only Russia has chosen to do so. About 1,000 Norwegians live in the main town of Longyear, where the airport is located. The Russian communities of Barentsburg and Pyramiden have fewer than 2,000 people. Spitzbergen includes several islands, covering a total area of almost 24,000 square miles (62,000 square km). The terrain is mountainous, with few roads and ice cliffs at the sea edge. The island is mentioned in the annals of 12th century Icelandic explorers. Its name in Norwegian, Svalbard, derives from the Old Norse meaning "cold coast". Spitzbergen became a major centre for whaling in the 17th century. In the early 20th century, the United States, Russia, Britain and others claimed mineral rights on the island, an issue that was resolved only with the 1920 treaty. During the Cold War, NATO member Norway and the Soviet Union agreed to keep the island demilitarised, despite its strategic importance in the Arctic. International oil companies have explored in the area for what are believed to be reserves of oil and gas but without much success. The need to protect the fragile Arctic environment has restricted oil exploration, although Norway has allowed some limited tourism.
