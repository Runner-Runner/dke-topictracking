A former tobacco company executive accused of accepting $4.5 million in bribes on Thursday was ordered extradited to Hong Kong to face charges there. A U.S. magistrate ordered Lui Kin-Hong, the former director of exports at the Hong Kong subsidiary of B.A.T Industries Plc, to return to Hong Kong to face nine charges he took bribes from a cigarette distributor, the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston said.   Judge Zachary Karol said he found sufficient evidence to support Hong Kong charges that Lui accepted about $3 million in outright payments and a further $1.5 million in unsecured loans from the principals of Giant Island Ltd. Lui allegedly took the payments from the distributor of British-American Tobaccco Co (HK) Ltd cigarettes to ensure that Giant Island was supplied with the most popular brands. Lui, who became a Canadian citizen in 1994, was arrested while on personal business in Boston in December last year and has been held in custody ever since. Lui argued that the extradition treaty between the United States and Britain would no longer include Hong Kong since the British protectorate will revert to China next year. Judge Karol concluded the U.S. Secretary of State and not the judiciary should determine whether or not Hong Kong's status would affect Liu's case, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston. -- Michael Ellis, Boston bureau, 617-637-4176
