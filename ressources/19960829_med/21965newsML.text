East German pharmaceutical manufacturers have made inroads into the west, German market selling more drugs there since unification, a pharmaceutical industry association said on Thursday. The Bundesverband der Pharmazeutischen Industrie (BPI) said east German drugs companies were quite keen to sell their goods in the west German market and posted a four percent increase in first-half domestic sales to 520 million marks. Also over 20 percent of all drugs sold by pharmacies was sold in west German states, the group added, saying that this marks an increase from the 16 percent sold in west Germany in the first half of 1995. But unification has taken its toll on the companies as the wave of job reductions continues, the BPI said. Currently east German drugs group employ nearly 5,520 workers, about 12 percent fewer than last year. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
