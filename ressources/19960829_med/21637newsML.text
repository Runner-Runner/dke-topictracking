The initial stock listing of consumer products seller Amway (Malaysia) Holdings Bhd on Friday is expected to draw a strong response for a company with a major market share and double-digit growth, analysts said on Thursday. The Malaysian subsidiary of Amway Asia Pacific Ltd will be the first direct seller to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and only the second Amway unit to be publicly traded in the region. The other is Amway Japan Ltd. The company made a public issue of 13.795 million new ordinary shares at 6.00 ringgit each. Analysts estimate the stock's fair value ranges from 9.90 to 12.40 ringgit. Demand for the offering is strong, said a dealer at a local firm, who said that no stock could be bought for even 12 ringgit a share. "This stock is incredible," he said. Analyst Lo Chok Ping at PhilleoAllied said Amway's strong turnover growth of 22 percent and earnings per share gains of 31 percent over the past five years augur well for the company, which sells products in home care, personal care and health and fitness segments.   "It seems to have quite good prospects," he said, noting that the company sells premium-quality products to a clientele that is mainly upper-middle income to middle income. Its products and service set it apart from competitors like U.S.-based Avon Products Inc, a direct seller of cosmetics and other products, and Cosway (M) Sdn Bhd, owned by Malaysian firm Berjaya Leisure Bhd, Lo said. A recent research report from Jupiter Securities noted that Amway has a "very strong" balance sheet, zero gearing and estimated cash reserves of 202.6 million ringgit. Based on the average price-to-earnings ratio for the consumer sector of 21 times for estimated 1997 earnings, Jupiter said it sees Amway in a fair trading range of 10 to 11 ringgit a share and recommends buying the stock under 10. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603 230 8911)
