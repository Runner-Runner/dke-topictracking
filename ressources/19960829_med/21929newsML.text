German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expects a visit to China, postponed by Beijing last June in protest at a Bonn parliamentary resolution on Tibet, to go ahead after a meeting with the Chinese foreign minister next month. Kinkel is due to meet his counterpart Qian Qichen at the United Nations general assembly in New York on September 24. "I believe that (after I meet Qian) the path can be smoothed for my visit, and for the frequency of visits in general to correspond again to the interests of both countries and the state of our relations," he told the daily Handelsblatt, according to an advance release from Friday's edition. Beijing was outraged by the lower house resolution, introduced by the major parties rather than the government, which accused China of trying to eradicate Tibet's cultural identity. It withdrew an invitation to Kinkel to visit in July, and Bonn responded by freezing high-level contacts. China often sees support for Tibetan interests or Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as implicit support for Tibetan independence. But Kinkel underlined that Germany did not recognise Tibet's self-styled government-in-exile or question the integrity of China's territory. "When the federal government speaks out in favour of respecting Tibetans' cultural and religious autonomy, it in no way supports efforts to give Tibet independence from the united Chinese state," he said. In a nod to critics who say Bonn kowtows too much to China, Kinkel said that "good political relations are vital if we want to achieve concrete progress in human rights". Kinkel said he hoped China would respect the opinions of the lower house as the views of an independent, elected parliament. "Between partners, it must be possible to air difficult issues," he said.
