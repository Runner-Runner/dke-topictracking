French stocks fell for the fourth day in a row on Thursday as the franc's weakness and fears of industrial unrest discouraged investors. The bourse closed near its lows after stronger-than-expected U.S. data raised expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates. The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished down 25.34 points, or 1.27 percent, at 1,977.56, while the CAC-40 August futures contract fell 24 points to 1,977.5. "We're not feeling good about this market," a trader said. "We're no longer expecting an interest rate cut before the end of the year." He said the market was waiting for the 1997 French budget, due to be presented next month, and for corporate first-half earnings results, which will start coming out next week. Turnover was 3.3 billion francs.
