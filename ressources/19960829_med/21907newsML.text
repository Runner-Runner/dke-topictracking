French voters are gripped by deepening gloom about the stagnating economy and saw no light at the end of the tunnel, an opinion poll showed on Thursday. The Ipsos survey, to be published on Friday in the weekly Le Point, said 77 percent of voters believed the economy was deteriorating and 62 percent thought it would keep doing so. Sixty-nine percent saw near-record unemployment worsening in the coming months, and the same percentage expected a wave of social unrest and strikes similar to those which crippled the country at the end of last year. A chorus of unions have predicted a tough autumn of social unrest. Voters gave good marks to the conservative government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe for keeping a firm hand in fighting illegal immigration and for plans to abolish military service. But 59 percent believed its economic policies, based on budget cuts in order to help qualify for the single European currency, would fail and 68 percent said the policies should be changed. Forty-six percent said President Jacques Chirac should fire Juppe while 44 percent said he should keep him. Sixty-two percent believed Juppe would stay. The voters' favourites to give the government fresh momentum, all conservatives, were National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin, hardline former interior minister Charles Pasqua, former prime minister Edouard Balladur and former finance minister Alain Madelin. Fifty-eight percent believed the opposition Socialists had no alternative economic policy proposals, to 31 percent who said they did.
