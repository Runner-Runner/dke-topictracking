India is heading for record sugar production this year, but production could fall off in the new season starting in October and the longer term is clouded, industry officials said on Thursday. They said India expected to produce 16.45 million tonnes of sugar in the 1995/96 season which began last October 1, sharply up from 14.6 million in the previous season. "Production is bound to be lower in 1996/97 because a lot of aberrations had taken place in the current season," S. L. Jain, secretary general of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, told Reuters. He forecast 1996/97 output at about 15 million tonnes. Jain said that next season he expected more sugarcane to be used in making jaggery and sulphur sugar. Industry officials said in the current season about 25 percent of sugarcane was being used to make jaggery and sulphur sugar. Jain said the share would rise to about 32 percent next season because domestic jaggery prices were high and sugar stocks were piling up. He said 1996/97 sugarcane output could also be 10 million tonnes lower than the current year's projected 280 million because of an anticipated reduction of the cane crop in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnatka. "It is too early to say but sugar production is bound to come down. The position definitely will not be as rosy," said V. M Bhatnagar, a senior official of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories. Bhatnagar said that on October 1, India would have sugar stocks of 8.0 million tonnes compared to 5.4 million one year earlier at the start of the 1995/96 season. That would hit the industry's liquidity position, he said. The sugar industry has asked the government to add 1.5 million tonnes to a sugar buffer stock currently set at 500,000 tonnes. Industry officials say a government buffer stock spares mill owners the expense of holding inventory, providing them with funds to clear accounts with sugarcane farmers. "There could be a severe reduction in sugar output in 1997/98. Farmers might divert to other crops," Bhatnagar said. "We may produce much less in 1997/98, though it is too early to say how much," said Jain. Jain said 1996/97 sugar consumption was expected to jump to 14 million tonnes from the present 13 million, and was due to rise to 14.5 million in 1997/98. He said the industry had already shipped 798,000 tonnes of sugar out of 1.0 million tonnes of exports allowed in 1995/96. The remaining would be shipped by the middle of October, he said. Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah told parliament on Monday that the government had authorised the Food Ministry to permit the export of 1.0 million tonnes of sugar in the 1996/97 season.
