The proportion of women aged 18 to 44 who have been tested for the AIDS virus rose by 69 percent (corrects the figure from 60 percent) between 1991 and 1993, federal health officials said on Thursday. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that in a 1993 telephone survey of 6,267 women aged 18 to 44, 31.8 percent said they had been tested at least once for HIV. In a 1991 survey of 13,411 women of the same age group, 18.8 percent said they had been been tested. "Information about HIV testing has gotten out there," said Jacqueline Wilson, a statistician with the CDC's National Centre for Health Statistics. In the 1993 survey, 46.1 percent of blacks, 39.7 percent of Hispanics and 27.9 percent of white women said they had been tested for the HIV virus which causes AIDS. Women who had not graduated from high school or who lived in poverty were more likely to have been tested, the survey found. The CDC said this was probably due to the availability of HIV testing at public health clinics. About 7,000 infants are born to HIV-infected women in the United States every year. The CDC said treatment of the mother with the drug AZT (zidovudine) may reduce the chances of a baby becoming infected with HIV. Without treatment, HIV-infected women have a 15 to 30 percent chance of infecting their baby during pregnancy or delivery. Medical treatment can reduce this to about a 1 in 12 chance, the CDC said. Women accounted for 19 percent of the 73,380 AIDS cases reported in 1995. The CDC said AIDS was the leading cause of death among black women aged 25 to 44 and the third leading cause of death among all women in that age bracket.
