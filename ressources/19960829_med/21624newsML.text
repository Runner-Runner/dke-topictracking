Electronics manufacturing services company Eltech Electronics Ltd said on Thursday it has conditionally agreed to sell its building in Singapore to Glenayre Electronics Singapore Pte Ltd for Singapore $13.1 million. Eltech said in a statement the net gain from the sale was estimated to be around S$3.6 million, which would be treated as an extraordinary gain. It said the deal was conditional on the agreement of the government and the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened unless the Singapore Stock Exchange waived the requirement. -Singapore newsroom 65-8703080
