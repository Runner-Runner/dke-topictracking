ValuJet Airlines flight attendants said on Wednesday they were trying to oust a union official who had asked the government to remove the grounded airline's management before letting it fly again. Susan Clayton, president of the local chapter of the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), last month asked the Department of Transportation to remove ValuJet's management before letting flights resume. However, union member Allison Beach told a news conference on Wednesday the company's current leadership was supported by "an overwhelming percentage of flight attendants." Beach said over 300 signatures had been collected on a petition asking for the removal of Clayton. "This represents well over half of the ValuJet flight attendants that are currently able to be contacted," Beach said. ValuJet had 660 flight attendants when it voluntarily shut down on June 17, following a crash in the Florida Everglades on May 11 that killed all 110 people on board. Flight attendant Christie Wright said the AFA had asked for a hearing to remove ValuJet officers, including president Lewis Jordan, without consulting union members who worked for the airline. "We want our jobs back. We want our company back," Wright said. The Department of Transportation has not said if it will conduct a hearing on the AFA petition asking for the removal of ValuJet's management. Beach said Clayton had not met with ValuJet union members since May 2. Since then, Clayton has charged that ValuJet officials repeatedly ignored safety-related complaints from flight attendants. Clayton and officials of the national union could not be reached for comment. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Wednesday that Jordan has told ValuJet employees it will be at least two weeks before the airline can obtain needed government approvals to resume operations. The grounded discount airline is awaiting a safety approval from the Federal Aviation Administration and clearance from the Department of Transportation, which has conducted a financial and management review of the carrier. Jordan said he was optimistic the FAA would clear ValuJet to resume operations by the end of this week, the newspaper said. "We continue to be in a position where (a restart date) is beyond our control," Jordan said.
