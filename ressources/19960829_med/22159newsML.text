The shareholders committee of the California Jockey Club alleged on Thursday that the company had filed a document containing "serious departures from the truth." The shareholders cited a document issued by the company August 27 stating that the committee advocated selling the company's real estate holdings. "Their suggestion that we advocated selling real estate is false," said Thomas Loran, a laywer for the committee. Christopher Kaufman, outside counsel to CJC, said the company had no comment on the allegation. The committee has fielded a five-member slate of candidates in Friday's board election. Meanwhile, GAMCO Investors Inc said on Thursday it plans to support the current board in the election. GAMCO is the largest single shareholder in CJC with 7.3 percent of the company's shares, Kaufman said. "We're disappointed because GAMCO had given us proxies in the last several weeks, which indicated that GAMCO supported us in the board election," Loran said.
