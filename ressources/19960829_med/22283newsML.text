COGA Industries LLC, a venture which includes units of Unicom Corp and Norsk Hydro a.s., said Thursday that Freeman Energy Corp agreed to supply up to 1.3 million tons of coal a year for use in COGA's $950 agricultural chemicals facility. Terms of the 20 year exclusive agreement were withheld. The plant, to be built near Girard, Ill., 30 miles southwest of Springfield, is expected to be in full operation in 1999. Freeman controls more than 500 million tons of recoverable coal in Illinois and currently operates four mines. The COGA plant will use high-sulfur coal in a coal gasification process that will produce about 1.6 million tons of granular and liquid nitrogenous fertilizer annually. The plant will convert local, high sulfur coal into coal gas for use as feedstock in the primary production of nitrogen fertililzers. COGA Industries is the developer for the project. The COGA project includes Unicom Resources Inc, a subsidiary of Unicom Corp; and Norsk Hydro a.s., a large fertilizer company based in Norway. Norsk Hydro and Unicom Resources has options for equity in the project. Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787
