U.S. stock index futures finished lower, battered first by strong U.S. data, then by technical deterioration. September Standard and Poor's 500 futures slumped to the lowest price since the market broke out to the upside in early August. Several layers of sell-stops and sell-programs were triggered during the session as September drifted through key support at 660.00, 659.80 and 659.20. The contract dipped below support at 655.50 to post a session low at 654.80 before recovering above the 655.50 support late. Support below there was now seen 653.10 and 651.00.   U.S. September Treasury bonds set the tone early, stumbling after a strong second-quarter gross domestic product revision. Growth was revised to 4.8 percent, above the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago. That figure took September Treasury bond futures through important support at 108-20/32, the 7 percent cash yield equivalent. Later, July single-family new home sales were reported up 7.9 percent, much higher than expected. Trading was rather quiet on the close, but bulls were shaken.   "We broke below the week's trading range and got down to 655.50 support and recovered from that, but I think we're still going to go lower," an S&P 500 futures trader said. He said weakness in the bond market over the past two weeks or so had finally taken a toll on stocks. Recent stock rallies have been labored and gains stalled out at 672.00, then 670.00 and 669.00, he said. "We held up well in the face of bond weakness, but now we're headed lower," he said.   September S&P 500 futures closed down 8.55 points to 657.15, Nikkei 225 futures fell 270.0 points to 20,510.0, Russell 2000 futures posted an 2.20 point loss to 334.00, NYSE Composite index fell 4.05 points to 353.15, Value Line fell 6.45 points to 618.30 and MidCap 400 fell 2.45 to 232.65. -Derivatives Desk, (312)408-8750;E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com
