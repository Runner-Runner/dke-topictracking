Polish shares fell on Thursday after Wednesday's rise but analysts said the stronger buying after price fixing signalled a rise on Friday with the market continuing this week's see-saw performance. "There seems to be a balance between buyers and sellers...we're currently near 13,700 points so it seems the market should stay within 13,500 and 14,000 over the next few sessions," said Dariusz Szepieniec of Bank Slaski brokerage. But some analysts saw possible growth, with the market getting a boost next week from funds returned after the recent oversubscription of the Kompap paper firm's public offering.   "If we have significant growth tomorrow followed by stronger buying after price-fixing then we can beat our recent (July 5, 14,282-point) high next week," said Artur Nagorka, a trader at Wood & Company. The main market's all-share WIG index fell 0.6 percent to 13,691.0 points and turnover fell 6.3 percent to 79.3 million zlotys on both markets. Analysts said another good sign were rises by some large- capitalised stocks such as Bank Gdanski and bank WBK, which set 52-week highs, rising 2.2 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.   Analysts said biggest mover Exbud, down 5.6 percent, fell in profit-taking after its surprising 10-percent jump on Wednesday. Continuous trade turnover was at 87,900 zlotys, with biggest mover Debica up 1.7 percent. No stocks had traded live on Wednesday. NFI units were flat at 87 zlotys in 7.6-million-zloty trade while in the continuous session they rose 2.9 percent to 89.5 zlotys, signalling possible growth in Friday's regular session after recent falls, analysts said. -- Steven Silber +48 22 653 9700
