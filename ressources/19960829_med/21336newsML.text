Polish deposit rates jumped on Thursday as the National Bank of Poland's drainages combined with the end of August's reserve period  squeezed the marekt, dealers said. They said rates have gone up after banks invested strongly in reverse repos and then started to borrow more funds needed to close August's reserve positions on Friday - the last working day of reserve period formally ending on Sunday. "Banks invested strongly in the NBP's operations which tightened the system's liquidity and overnight deposits rates may rally on Friday," said Marek Wieczorkiewicz from PKO BP.
