Slow-developing soybean plants in the U.S. Midwest need warm nights, daytime temperatures in the low 80s (Fahrenheit) and regular rainfall throughout September to reach maturity on time, agronomists said. "Night temperatures are extremely critical in September," said Ellsworth Christmas, agronomist at Purdue University. Without the warm temperatures, farmers can expect "smaller beans and maybe fewer beans," he added. Temperatures below 60 degrees will retard soybean growth and at 40 degrees the plant will stop developing for one full day, Christmas said.
