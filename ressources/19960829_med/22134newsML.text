Forty top U.S. business leaders endorsed President Clinton on Thursday, praising him for the job he has done in managing the economy in his first term and voicing optimism about the economic outlook during a second. "Over the last four years, President Clinton has proved that he is the right chief executive officer to lead America into the 21st century," Xerox Corp chairman Paul Allaire told reporters. "Whether it is creating jobs, cutting the deficit, expanding trade or investing in education and technology, the president has shown leadership." Among those joining Allaire to endorse Clinton at the Democratic Party national convention were Sara Lee Corp chairman John Bryan, Travelers Insurance Holdings Inc president Lyndon Olson and Loral Space and Communications Ltd chairman Bernard Schwartz. "We have in place the strongest economy in a generation and the elements for continued sustained expansion," said Steven Rattner, managing director for Wall Street investment banker Lazard Freres and Co.
