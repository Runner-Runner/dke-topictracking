Venezuela will start talks with the International Monetary Fund to move towards an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program in the final quarter of this year, a top official said on Thursday. "This program will allow...the design and execution of structural reforms which will improve the competitivity and growth of the Venezuelan economy," Luis Enrique Berrizbeitia said during a seminar. The IMF approved a $1.4 billion 12- month stand-by credit for Venezuela in July to support an economic reform program launched in mid-April. Venezuela has already received a first installment of $500 million on the stand-by loan. -- Omar Lugo, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
