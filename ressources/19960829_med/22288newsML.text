The Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) weekly Future Inflation Gauge (FIG) rose to 105.1 in the week ended August 16 from 104.8 the previous week, ECRI said. Faster growth of real estate loans, continued low initial jobless claims and a drop in the growth rate of industrial materials prices contributed to the rise, ECRI said. "The gauge is no longer pointing to much disinflation ahead, but there is not yet a marked increase in underlying inflation pressures," ECRI said. --N.A. Treasury Desk 212-859-1660
