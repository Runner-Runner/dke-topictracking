Boston Edison Co's 670 megawatt Pilgrim nuclear power plant is operating at full power after cutting production last weekend for a power suppression test, a company spokeswoman said. "We reached 100 percent output on Wednesday," spokeswoman Carol Wightman said Thursday. The unit, located at Plymouth, Mass., was reduced to about 66 percent power during testing, and began boosting output early Wednesday, the spokeswoman said. -- New York Power Desk 212-859-1627
