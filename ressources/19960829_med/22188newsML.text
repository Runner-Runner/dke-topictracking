Paradoxx Music and Imprint Records said in a joint statement that they have entered a licensing agreement for Imprint products in Brazil. "Although not yet a major territory for country music, Brazil is one of those frontiers that has shown a good appetite for good music... no matter what the format," Imprint chairman and chief executive officer Roy Wunsch said in a statement. Paradoxx currently has the largest market share of any independent label in Brazil and the Paradoxx's staff has experience on major record labels, the companies said.
