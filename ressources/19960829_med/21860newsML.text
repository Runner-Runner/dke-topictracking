Orange County, Calif., supervisors agreed to shift $15 million into a special account that could be used to defease county bankruptcy recover bonds, a county spokeswoman said on Thursday. In June, the county Board of Supervisors authorized the chief executive officer to create the debt repayment account, which would be funded with general fund carry over balances. On Wednesday, the supervisors formally ratified the transfer of $14.8 million into the special account from fiscal year 1995-1996, county spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. Orange County emerged from 18 months of bankruptcy in June following the successful sale of about $880 million of certificates of participation and bonds. The county Board of Supervisors was expected to vote on the county budget for fiscal year 1996-1997 on September 24.
