The Mexican peso continued to take a beating on Thursday afternoon on reaction to new rebel violence in two Mexican states and from higher yields on the U.S. long bond, traders said. The benchmark 48-hour or spot peso closed four centavos weaker to 7.5350/7.5400, while the 24-hour peso lost 2.8 centavos to 7.5160/7.5230. Earlier on Thursday, the same-day peso closed two centavos weaker to 7.5040/7.5070   "Some people are saying the internal problems of Mexico aren't that serious to move the markets too abruptly," one dealer said. "But foreigners are not going to risk their money when there are armed conflicts in the country." Apart from the rebel violence, higher rates on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond pressured the peso. The long-bond yield climbed as high as 7.05 percent on Thursday afternoon after a hefty upward revision of U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product.   "The long bond was an additional risk factor for investment in Mexico," one dealer said. --Alexis Quiones, Mexico City newsroom, (525) 728 9555
