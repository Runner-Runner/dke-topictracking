Bangchak Petroleum Plc, which tendered earlier this week to buy October crude oil, has received offers for MidEast crude but not for Far East grades, industry sources said on Thursday. A source said 10 cargoes of Oman crude were offered at prices ranging from MPM plus 2.5 cents per barrel to plus five cents. One cargo of Iranian crude and a cargo of Murban were also offered into the tender, the sources said.   But the sources said no regional grades were offered and so the refinery was likely to talk directly with producers and traders at a later date to cover this requirements. A source said the refinery was likely to favor the Oman crude over Murban or Iranian grades because it was better suited to the refinery's system. The tender, which closed on Wednesday with validity to 1800 hours Bangkok time Thursday, had sought 500,000 barrels of October lifting MidEast crude and 600,000 barrels of October lifting light sweet regional grades. --Singapore Newsroom (+65 870 3081)
