Leading Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd said on Thursday it would open a gasoline station on August 31 together with McDonald's Co (Japan) Ltd, a unit of McDonald's Corp, in Saitama prefecture north of Tokyo. Drivers will pay for gasoline at a cashier within McDonald's, Idemitsu said. Monthly gasoline sales are targeted at about 300 kilolitres, about 20 percent more than an average Idemitsu gasoline stand. Gasoline stands in Japan are struggling to survive. Gasoline retail prices fell ahead of the deregulation in imports this April, and have not fully recovered.
