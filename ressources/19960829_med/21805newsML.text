Elvis Costello is unlikely to continue playing with the band The Attractions when their current North American tour is over, the British rock star's press agent said on Thursday. Costello reunited with The Attractions two years ago after an eight year hiatus. The band first became famous in the punk-rock days of 1978 before splitting up after 1985's "Blood and Chocolate" album. "I don't think he'll be working with The Attractions again," said Bill Bentley,  Costello's press agent at Warner Bros. Records. Costello told a crowded house of fans at the Universal Amphitheatre in Hollywood on Wednesday: "This will probably be the last time we ever play Los Angeles, so let's have a good time." Elvis Costello and The Attractions have just three more dates left in their North American tour. The band plays in Berkley, Calif. on Friday followed by Portland, Ore. on Saturday before closing in Seattle on Sunday. Wednesday's show was a two-hour set anchored by a host of clasics from one of Costello's earliest albums "This Year's Model" including a psychedelic version of "I Don't Want To Go To Chelsea." With fans on their feet screaming "We love you Elvis" the band ended their final Los Angeles concert with a 15 minute rendition of Elvis' own personal favourite "I Want You" which he peppered with lyrics from the Aretha Franklin classic "I Say A Little Prayer For You." The band was touring to promote their latest offering "All This Useless Beauty." After the American leg of the tour the band moves on to Japan where it will play their final date on Sept. 15.
