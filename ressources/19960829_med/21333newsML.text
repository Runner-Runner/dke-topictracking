Bosnia's ruling Moslem party sought international assurances on upcoming elections on Thursday, one day after urging refugees not to cast absentee ballots until voter registration irregularities were resolved. More than 641,000 Bosnian refugees, the majority of them Moslems, had been scheduled to start voting by absentee ballot on Wednesday. It was unclear what percentage had responded to SDA's call. Election day inside Bosnia is September 14. Halid Genjac, a spokesman for the ruling Moslem nationalist SDA party, said on Thursday no refugee should be allowed to vote from anywhere other than his pre-war place of residence. He also called for international guarantees that no Bosnian faction which becomes a party to the joint governmental institutions being formed through the elections would be able to stall action by refusing to particiapte. "In this moment we do not have sufficient guarantees to be able to wait for election results with ease," Genjac said. "We are asking for those guarantees and international community has to give them."
