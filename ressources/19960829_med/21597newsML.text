China urged its publishers and paper producers to form an alliance to deflect competition from imported newsprint and protect the domestic paper industry, a Newspaper Association document showed on Thursday. A document obtained from a recent meeting of the Association showed that publishers were encouraged to use paper produced in China when it was similar to foreign paper in quality and price. Officials at the meeting also called for a cut in the price of domestic newsprint and the formation of long-term cooperation between publishers and paper producers on paper production and sales, it said. Imports of high-quality foreign newsprint this year should be sufficient only for printing colour newspapers by imported high-speed printers so as to protect fledgling domestic paper producers, the association said. Domestic newsprint was priced at about 6,600 yuan per tonne, 1,000 yuan above the world price, which has been sliding after a sharp upturn. China has imported more than 50,000 tonnes of foreign newsprint in the first seven months of this year, the document said. Newsprint output in China would be 810,000 tonnes in 1996, exceeding demand estimated at 750,000 tonnes, it said. China has 5,600 pulp and paper factories, producing 21.4 million tonnes of paper each year, the report said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)
