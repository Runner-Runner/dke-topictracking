The Peruvian government has proposed a 1997 budget of about 24 billion soles, up from 22.263 billion soles this year, Transport Minister Elsa Carrera de Escalante said Thursday.   "In the cabinet meeting last night, we dealt with the topic of the budget," she told reporters. "This is going to be slightly higher than last year, around 24 billion soles." She added that the government was putting the finishing touches on its budget proposal, which would be sent to Congress later Thursday.   The government had until Friday to present its proposal for the 1997 budget. Although the 1997 budget proposal is nominally higher than 1996, accumulated inflation for the first seven months was 7.84 percent and is expected to exceed 11 percent by year's end. According to Congress' budget committee, the government has so far spent 41 percent of its 1996 budget and expects to spend only 93 percent by the end of the year.   Congress now has until November 30 to debate and approve the budget. The 1996 budget was based on an exchange rate of 2.40 soles to the dollar, whereas that rate is now up to 2.61. -- Andrew Cawthorne, Lima newsroom
