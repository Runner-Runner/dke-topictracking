The won closed slightly higher versus the dollar on Thursday as dollar buying power simmered down on fears of a central bank dollar selling, dealers said. The won stood at 819.10 at the closing bell against the opening and intraday low of 819.50. It peaked at 818.80. "Possibility of a central bank intervention amid short dollar positions is the only thing that is keeping the dollar weak," said one trader. Traders said the Bank of Korea is likely to step in, if the won falls below 820.   "The central bank is expected to intervene, if the dollar rises above 820 on Friday," said a local dealer. Dealers expect the won to hover around the 819 level on Friday with the mid-rate at 819.20, unchanged from today. -- JEAN YOON (822) 727 5643
