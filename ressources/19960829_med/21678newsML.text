A 62-year-old man was being held Thursday after his arrest on charges of causing two bomb scares at the Maryland state capitol building, police said. Daniel James, whose last known address was in Washington, was arrested by Maryland state police shortly after he allegedly placed a "hoax device" at a basement entrance to the Maryland State House. The building was evacuated while a bomb squad examined the package, which resembled one left at the same location Aug. 5. Police spokesman Michael McKelvin said the package was about the size of a pad of legal paper and was addressed to Maryland Gov. Paris Glendening. Inside were photocopied sheets of apparently random paragraphs, including "some anti-government stuff," McKelvin said. The first package had similar contents, he said. "We're just trying to put together the puzzle," he said. James was denied bail after he failed to speak at a hearing at the Anne Arundel County district courthouse.
