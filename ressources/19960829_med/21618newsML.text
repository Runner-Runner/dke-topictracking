Shenzhen Development Bank Ltd said on Thursday that the 68 percent surge in its interim net profits for 1996 resulted from successful expansion. In an interim report published in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times, the bank said that under Chinese accounting standards, it posted audited net earnings of 364.23 million yuan compared with 216.50 million yuan in the same period last year. Per share earnings, however, dropped to 0.35 yuan from 0.50 yuan in the January-June period of 1995, the bank said. The bank implemented a ten-for-ten bonus share distribution earlier this year as dividend for 1995. Its main operating income reached 1.14 billion yuan, up 36 percent over the year earlier's level of 842.50 million yuan, the report said. The Shenzhen-listed market leader said that as of June 30 of 1996, its deposits balance hit 19.463 billion yuan, up 43.62 percent over the year-earlier level, with lending reaching 13.621 billion yuan, up 38.12 percent. The company, the sole bank listed in China, said the steep rise in its first half profits was fuelled in part by a 61.53 percent surge in earnings derived from its foreign exchange business. The sector generated net profits of US$24.10 million, equivalent to 200.52 million yuan in the first half, accounting for 46.92 percent of the bank's 1996 interim net. Development Bank said it plans to expand its banking network in mainland China and renovate facilities for banking service in the second half of this year. It has so far opened 91 branches across China, with four set up in the first half of 1996. Shenzhen Development Bank said in its annual report for 1995 that it had after-tax profits of 435.13 million yuan last year, compared with 356.33 million yuan in the previous year. Main operating income reached 2.105 billion yuan, compared with 1.366 billion yuan in 1994. Shenzhen Development Bank evolved from the merger of six agricultural credit cooperatives eight years ago. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6441
