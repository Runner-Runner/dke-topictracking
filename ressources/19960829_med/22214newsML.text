Nasdaq stocks followed the rest of the market lower as economic data indicated an economy which was stronger than expected, reawakening concern about interest rates and inflation. The Nasdaq Composite did a bit better than the Dow Industrials as economically sensitive stocks like the high techs would actually benefit from a stronger eceonomy. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 8.86 points, or 0.77 percent, at 1145.02 while declines led advances by 2230 to 1703 on volume of about 428 million shares. "The weakest part of the market are the big blue chips and the defensive sectors. The economically sensitive areas, like the semiconductors, electrical defense and other technology stocks are doing relatively better than the rest of the market," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. Shares of Sierra Semiconductor Corp closed up 2-5/8 at 11-7/8 in active trading on the expectation that the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business. --Andrej Gustincic Wall Street desk 212-859-1731
