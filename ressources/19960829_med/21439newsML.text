Mexico's same-day Cetes rate ended a nervous trading session 150 basis points lower at 21.50 percent, but dealers said the decline was not representative of the day's trading activity. "What happened is that there was not a lot of Cetes at the end and people had to buy for the end of the month. The last trade was only 40 million pesos," one dealer said. Analysts said that the average trading rate for the government paper was 23.25 percent.   Dealers expect an increase in rates at the next primary Cetes auction on Tuesday. "With all that has happened if you think that rates are going to increase, you will go short and keep liquid so you can invest in paper that gives a better yield," one dealer said. The market was nervous over the upcoming state of the union address by President Ernesto Zedillo on Sunday, over the rising yield on the U.S. long bond and due to attacks by rebels in two Mexican states late on Wednesday. Bank notes and acceptances, including pagares, fell 14 basis points to 24.50 percent. Banco de Mexico injected 3.860 billion pesos in three credit auctions. For Friday, the shortfall is seen about 5,800 billion pesos, due to a maturing bank credits, tax payments and the outflow of funds for the end of the month. --Karina Balderas, Mexico City newroom (525) 728 9562
