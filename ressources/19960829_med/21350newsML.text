Poland's lower house of parliament on Thursday gave more powers to tax collectors, hoping to help curb tax evasion in the country's vast shadow economy. Deputies voted 297 to 82 with 12 abstentions to support the bill, which gives inspectors access to all banking information concerning a person or firm under criminal or tax investigation. Inspectors abusing their access to confidential information would face up to three years in jail. The law, which must still clear the Senate and be signed by President Aleksander Kwasniewski, also allows inspectors to use intelligence techniques, such as telephone tapping. But parliament rejected a government proposal to let selected tax inspectors bear arms, search premises or cars. The new regulations also allow tax collectors to probe businesses which are not officially registered and force them to pay taxes. Under the bill, tax collectors could ask individuals about source of their declared wealth and force them to pay tax if it turns out they had an undeclared income. Analysts say that Poland's shadow economy generates 20 to 30 percent of gross domestic product. Business groups blame high taxes for widespread evasion. The corporate income tax is now at 40 percent and personal income tax rates range between 21 percent and 45 percent.
