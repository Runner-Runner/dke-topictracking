The European Union on Thursday ended negative correctives on soft and durum wheat flour and on durum wheat semolina, France's grain office ONIC said. Officials said they did not know when the decision would become effective. Until now operators exported wheat flour and semolina using prefixed licenses carrying a zero subsidy. But to keep the subsidy at zero negative correctives, equivalent to the monthly increment paid to traders, were applied. By cancelling the correctives, the EU is encouraging flour and semolina exports, grain trade sources said. --Paris Newsroom
