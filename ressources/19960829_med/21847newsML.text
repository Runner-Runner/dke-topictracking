California construction volume for July totaled $3.08 billion, up 1.4 percent from June and up 12.8 percent from July 1995, the Construction Industry Research Board said on Thursday. Ben Bartolotto, director of the Research Board, said total construction volume in the first seven months climbed to $18.7 billion, up from $17.6 billion during the first seven months last year, reflecting a six percent increase. For 1996, the Research Board was forecasting a 4.3 percent increase in construction to $31.14 billion from 1995's $29.85 billion, with a 14.2 percent rise in 1997 to $35.14 billion.   The California construction volume, measured by building permits and contract awards, showed a positive increase in all categories in July with the exception of multi-family housing units, which showed a decline in both the prior and year-ago months, the Research Board said. Bartolotto revised the Research Board's 1996 heavy construction forecast up $100 million to $6.80 billion in total contracts. In addition, the 1997 forecast for streets, highways and bridges was increased to $2.76 billion, up 10 percent from 1996. Bartolotto said this increase was due mainly to increased funding under a seismic retrofit bond act approved by voters in March.
