Dutch-Belgian financial group Fortis should strengthen its position in the Netherlands, Fortis co-chairman Maurice Lippens said on Thursday. "The position of (insurer) AMEV and VSB (bank) on the Dutch market is a bit too weak. The Netherlands is prime development country for us, we believe we're not strong enough there," Lippens told a news conference. But Lippens, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of Fortis' Belgian arm Fortis AG, added Fortis was now not in any takeover talks in the Netherlands. Lippens also said Germany remained an attractive market for Fortis but that there was not much takeover potential there for the moment. -- Bert Lauwers, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6815, Fax +32 2 230 7710
