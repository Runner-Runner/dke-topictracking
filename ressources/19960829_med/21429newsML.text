Caracas stocks closed off Thursday, dented by Wednesday's suspension of Banco de Venezuela's sale, but greater slippage was stemmed by investors who saw a buying opportunity, traders said. "The bolsa fell on the news of the sale's suspension," said Multinvest broker Jose Gregorio Tineo. But "the fall was less than expected as buyers stepped in, especially for Electricidad" he added. The market's 19-share index lost 1.56 percent to end at 4,664.42 as 16.6 million shares traded worth 4.7 billion bolivars ($8.9 million).   Benchmark stock Electricidad de Caracas lost 7.00 bolivars to close at 400.00, a lesser fall than many brokers expected. "Despite what's happened with Banco de Venezuela its a positive sign that the government is still working to keep to the privatization schedule for other companies," said one broker who bought Electricidad. Strong trade in the stock accounted for 75 percent of the session's total, some nine million shares. "There's still strong interest in Electricidad," he said.
