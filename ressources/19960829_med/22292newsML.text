AccuStaff Inc said Thursday it was raising its expectations for growth by its information technology staffing business. Earlier this week the company and Career Horizons Inc said that Career Horizons would merge with AccuStaff. In addition, Career Horizons announced that it bought Berger & Co., a technology consulting and staffing services company. The purchase should give the combined information technology division annualized revenues of more than $500 million by the end of 1997, said chairman Derek Dewan. "Our goal is for the revenues of our professional services division to account for more than 50 percent of total estimated 1997 combined revenues of $1.7 billion," Dewan said. "The rapid growth in our IT business, which is the fastest-growing segment of our professional services division, will make a significant contribution toward achieving that goal,"  Dewan said.
