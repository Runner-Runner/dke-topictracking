The Indian rupee weakened against the U.S. currency to end Thursday at 35.75/76 per dollar, down from the day's opening quotes of 35.73/76, dealers said. The rupee weakened initially on short-covering by banks and later on dollar purchases by a large state-run bank, they said. Dollar supplies at higher levels kept the rupee from sliding beyond 35.78, they said.   The rupee traded at a high of 35.75 and a low of 35.78. Forward premia fell slightly as domestic liquidity was good, dealers said. The premia for six-month dollars ended Thursday at an annualised rate of 11.02 percent against the previous close of 11.08 percent, dealers said. -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000
