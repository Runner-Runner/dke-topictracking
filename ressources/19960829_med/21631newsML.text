A Taiwan shipper said on Thursday its application to sail directly to China from the island had been rejected by its Chinese counterpart, clouding direct shipping links between the rivals. On August 20, China issued rules governing direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, effective immediately, but Taiwan gave a cool response, saying Beijing's rules were "mingled with sensitive political issues". "We sent documents to the shipping company in (China's) Xiamen telling them we wanted to sail from (Taiwan's) Kaohsiung to Xiamen," said a manager of Kien Hung Shipping Co Ltd. "But they said the application could not be accepted because they haven't prepared such application forms," the manager, who declined to be named, said by telephone. He said requests from other Taiwanese shippers for direct shipping links were also denied by Chinese counterparts. "We hope the problem is only paperwork," the manager said. "We will apply again when their forms are ready." China's regulations allow wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides. Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the civil war to the Chinese communists and fled to the island in 1949. Taiwan investors, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, have pressured their government to establish direct links to save transport costs. To fulfil its ambition of becoming a regional hub, Taiwan proposed in 1995 to set up an offshore transshipment centre at southern Kaohsiung port from which ships would be allowed to sail directly between Taiwan and China. The project has been delayed by sovereignty issues. Taiwan insists on a transshipment centre, from which no goods would be allowed through its customs. With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in Hong Kong, Macau or another third place.
