U.S. September spot natgas prices in the West Texas and Midcontinent markets turned lower Thursday as a significant drop in demand was expected for the holiday weekend, sources said. In the Permian basin, traders reported closing most September deals in the high-$1.40s to low-$1.50s per million British thermal units, down more than 10 cents from Wednesday's levels. Waha prices carried about a seven-cent premium to Permian in the mid-to-high $1.50s, while at the southern California border prices held in the high-$1.60s.   August Topock prices were pegged in the mid-$1.60s. On Northern, September prices at Demarcation were steady to softer in the low-to-mid $1.60s. Prices for Friday delivery at Demarcation were in a similar range, but on Panhandle and ANR prices were talked lower in the low-to-mid $1.50s. Because nomination deadlines for September 1 have expired on the Gulf and most of the Midcontinent pipes, September trading was non-existent. Therefore, today's prices are considered "notional." Active trading is expected to resume next Tuesday following the Labor Day Holiday. For Friday delivery, U.S. Gulf Coast prices began this morning's trading in the $1.80s but quickly fell into the $1.70s as pipelines heavily discounted transportation rates through the weekend. In south Texas, August prices were talked in the mid-$1.60s. --H McCulloch, New York Power Desk +212-859-1628
