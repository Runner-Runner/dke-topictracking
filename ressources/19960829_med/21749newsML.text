Meat and pork production in Russia is plummeting for the fifth year in a row, creating a long-term opening for imports, a U.S. agricultural attache said in a report released Thursday. Meat processors are so dependent on beef imports, the attache in Moscow reported, that "(our) Post sees little risk of additional barriers being erected to American exports." Pork was in a similar situation, so even the May imposition of floor limits on import duties would not dent imports.   Beef imports of about 500,000 tonnes a year will be needed, the attache said, and pork imports of 350,000 tonnes this year. Pork imports could climb to 400,000 tonnes in 1997. Russian beef production was projected to fall seven percent this year, continuing the trend that started with free market reforms in 1991, the report said. Overall, demand for meat in Russia totals about 8 million tonnes but production was about 5.5 million tonnes in 1995, the attache wrote. The gap would be filled by poultry, meat imports and a shift to fish and other meat substitutes.   "Meat imports into Russia should rise for the next several years," the report said. Russia and the United States recently resolved a dispute over poultry sales that jeopardized trade for several months. Russia is the No 1 market for U.S. poultry exports. Russian beef imports were a record 370,000 tonnes in 1994 and 450,000 tonnes in 1995. "In the near term, the outlook for beef production in Russia is not promising," the attache said. "A turnaround in the industry should not be expected any time soon."   Beef and pork production in Russia is inefficient by world standards, the attache said. In the past five years, pork has become the most expensive meat in Russia. In June, average pork prices were 15-20 percent higher than beef and 25-30 percent higher than poultry. Pork imports totaled 210,000 tonnes in 1994 and 310,000 tonnes in 1995. The attache estimated Russia's cattle inventory at 43.3 million head in 1995, 39.7 million at the start of this year and 36.5 million at the start of next year.   Pork inventory was pegged at 15.6 million head in 1995, 14.4 million at the start of this year and 13.3 million at the start of 1997. A related report released by the department said during the first six months of this year, Russia imported $212.25 million in frozen poultry, $249.5 million of frozen beef and $108 million in frozen pork.
