China will not allow political differences with Taiwan to interfere with trade and investment, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told a group of visiting Taiwanese business leaders on Thursday. "We advocate not letting political differences affect and interfere with economic cooperation between the two sides," state radio quoted Jiang as saying.   The economies of China and Taiwan were complementary, Jiang said, adding that the two sides should strengthen economic cooperation to benefit the entire Chinese race. Nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile, 12-day visit. Taiwanese economic officials are visiting in a private capacity. Beijing has recently stepped up pressure on the island to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport. China unilaterally announced last week a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links.
