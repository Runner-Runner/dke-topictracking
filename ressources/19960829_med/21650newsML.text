Kuala Lumpur Second Board stocks ended lower for the first time this week as buyers took a pause following three days of record-setting gains. Blue chips also finished with losses, but their declines were less pronounced. "It's been a roller-coaster ride for Second Board players," said one institutional dealer with a foreign house. "I'm still recovering from the ride." After barely straying into positive ground, the blue chip dominated Composite Index ended down 0.84 points or 0.08 percent to 1,110.49. The Second Board dropped 10.69 points or 1.97 percent to 531.06 after hitting a session peak of 545.44.   At the end of trading, over 220 million shares had changed hands, with the main board slightly outpacing the Second Board in volume. Losers topped gainers by 367 to 180. Drawing the strongest volume at over 8.9 million shares was newly-listed Powertek Bhd, which ended at 6.60 ringgit against an offer price of 3.90. The power company is Malaysia's first listing of an infrastructure project. Repco, a timber and gaming concern, rose 1.00 to 63.50 ringgit after a two-week suspension. It will buy a sawmill holding company for 25 million ringgit.
