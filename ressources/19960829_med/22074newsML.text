Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing chairman and CEO, L.D. DeSimone, said on Thursday that he is comfortable with earnings per share projections of $3.55 to $3.60 in 1996. "The consensus for earnings is between $3.55 and $3.60 a share. That is about an 11 percent increase and we've said we're comfortable with that," DeSimone told Reuters in a telephone. "We feel that's a fair estimate...excluding any charges." In 1995, the diversified manufacturer had $3.23 earnings per share, excluding one-time charges.   During the company's bi-annual investors meeting this morning, 3M projected a 12 percent increase in operating earnings in 1996 over 1995, on a sales increase of five percent. Minnesota Mining CFO, Giulio Agostini, presented graphics that indicated the company would have operating income of $2.49 billion and revenues of $14.16 billion in 1996. This represents a 12 percent increase over 1995 operating income of $2.22 billion and a five percent increase over the company's 1995 revenues of $13.46 billion.   Minnesota Mining's vice chairman and executive VP, Ron Mitsch, told the investors that over the next several years, the industrial and consumer sector's operating income would increase in excess of 13 percent per year, while revenues would grow at about 10 percent. "We expect sales to increase, exclusive of currency changes, at about 10 percent per year, mostly from unit volume gains," Mitsch said.  "We expect to increase profits faster than the 13 percent rate of the last three years. Our profit margin target is still 20 percent."   In 1995, the industrial and consumer sector had an operating margin of 16 percent, with $1.34 billion in operating income on sales of $8.36 billion. In the telephone interview, DeSimone said he expected the following businesses to have revenue growth above the company's average: signing, chemicals, visual systems and pharmaceuticals. DeSimone also identifies the geographies with the fastest revenue growth rates. "Asia will be the fastest growth," he said.  "(With) Asia first, Eastern Europe and Latin America will have the fastest growth rate, in that order."   DeSimone expected productivity, as measured by sales per employee, to grow at eight percent in 1996. "Our target is eight percent," he said. "We hope to hit that by the end of the year." DeSimone said costs for research and development would be about 6.7 percent in 1996. "Our target is between 6.5 an seven percent," he said. "Somewhere around 6.7 (percent)...That's an efficient place for us. It gives us enough growth. We're pretty close to that right now." From 1992 to 1995, research and development as a percent of Minnesota Mining's sales fell to 6.6 percent from 7.4 percent. -- Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787
