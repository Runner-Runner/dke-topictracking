German sugar production in 1996/97 may be below last year's levels because of lower sugar content although beet yields should be higher, the Germany's farm ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The ministry said the beet harvest area should be 516,000 hectares, up 0.5 percent from last year, but did not elaborate further. The statement, which was issued as part of a set of harvest statistics, was in contrast to that by sugar industry association WVZ on Monday, which predicted higher sugar output. Although WVZ used the same area figure, it based its estimate on the assumption of a 17 percent final sugar content compared with last year's 16.73. WVZ will conduct three more fortnightly sugar beet tests -- with the next one due on Sept 2 -- to gain more clarity on the sugar content scenario. -Bonn newsroom, +49-228-26097146
