General Nutrition Cos Inc said on Thursday it will continue to offer nutritional supplements with ephedra, an herbal stimulant, but it will offer versions without the agent that is under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scrutiny. General Nutrition said it will comply with whatever decision the FDA makes regarding ephedra. Also, the retailer of vitamins and food supplements is working with third party vendors to have ephedra-free versions of products by mid-October, the company said. Ephedra is a key ingredient in ephedrine, an agent found in asthma medicines. However, ephedrine is also found in products, which are marketed as agents that produce feelings of euphoria, that led to overdose deaths. A FDA's advisory panel is reviewing data about the safety of ephedra, but a final ruling would take several months. General Nutrition said it will continue to work through trade groups that are seeking a compromise of allowing products with low levels of ephedra to remain on the market. General Nutrition noted that it has been successful in marketing ephedra-free products in Ohio, where products containing ephedra have been banned since December 1994.
