Madrid shares closed sharply lower on Thursday as a spillover of losses from Wall Street hit prices, dealers said. Stocks were affected by a strong upwards revision in US second quarter GDP, renewing rate hike jitters there, they said. The general index shed 2.79 points, 0.78 percent, to 355.69 and the Ibex-35 fell 38.28 points, 0.94 percent, to 4,046.18. Energy group Repsol rose 25 pesetas to 4,110, off a high after first half results which got a mixed reading from analysts. Some predicted more share price weakness. Telefonica dropped 65 pesetas to 2,320 on talk that analysts are downgrading first half profits forecasts. "People were talking about a 20 percent rise in profit. Now they're revising to an around 17 percent increase," said a trader. Insurance firm Mapfre ended up 70 pesetas at 6,120, but off highs after announcing a fall in first half results. Total volume was about 28 billion pesetas.
