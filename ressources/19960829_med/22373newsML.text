Red Lion Hotels Inc shares were bid at 26 in the U.S. pre-open, above Wednesday's 23-5/8 close after news it is having preliminary discussions about being acquired by Doubletree Corp, traders said. Red Lion said the discussions are still at an early stage and may not lead to a definitive agreement. The company said the discussions do not involve the Red Lion Inns LP. Separately, National Semiconductor Corp was bid slightly higher at 16-1/2 ahead of the market opening, up from Wednesday's 16-3/8 finish. Prudential Securities started coverage with a buy rating, a market source said.   A trader noted Novell Inc shares were "trading right in line (with Wednesday's 11 close) but would guess it'll trade a little higher." Novell said Robert Frankenberg resigned as chairman, CEO and president. It named board member John Young, a past president and CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co, as chairman. Joseph Marengi, formerly executive vice president of worldwide sales, was named president. Novell has begun a search for a new CEO. It did not give a reason for Frankenberg's departure. Traders saw a quiet trading day ahead as Monday's Labor Day holiday looms, despite the morning deluge of economic data.   "The holiday is a lot more powerful than these economic numbers," one trader laughed. -- Betty Wong, Wall Street desk, 212 859 1721
