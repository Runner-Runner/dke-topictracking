The Justice Department said Thursday it has settled a pair of discrimination complaints involving moviegoers with hearing problems and a motel that denied a room to two vacationers in wheelchairs. In the first case, Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon Corp., one of the largest U.S. movie theater operators, has agreed to provide special listening devices for those who are hard of hearing, it said. A complaint by a hearing-impaired woman from Boise, Idaho and a New York lawyers group charged that many of the firm's 800 theaters nationwide lacked the devices, which require special receivers on headsets provided by the theater. Justice Department officials said Cineplex Odeon already has begun to install new or upgraded systems in theaters around the country. "This agreement established a model for the industry that we hope others will follow," Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick said in a statement. In the second case, a motel in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina has agreed to pay more than $90,000 in damages to settle charges it told two wheelchair-bound vacationers with cerebral palsy to leave, the department said. It said the settlement resolved a lawsuit alleging that the Ocean Plaza Motel had violated the Americans with Disabilities law. The motel also agreed to change its discriminatory policy. The case involved Debra Jones and Jackie Chaney, both of whom are 22 and have cerebral palsy. Their mothers made reservations for the foursome at the motel as a graduation present. After they checked in on July 21, 1995, motel owner Marie Wynock saw the two in wheelchairs in the parking lot and told the mothers "handicapped" persons could not stay there. She took back the room key and refunded their money. Under the settlement, the hotel agreed to pay $92,000 plus interest in damages to the families and a $5,000 civil penalty to the federal government, the Justice Department said.
