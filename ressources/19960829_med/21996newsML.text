Two people were killed by gunshots and another by a grenade when Burmese border guards attacked a group of Bangladeshi woodcutters near the frontier, police said on Thursday. They said Burmese guards, called Nasaka, entered several miles into the Bangladesh territory at Naikhyangchhari in Bandarban district, 45 km (30 miles) from Cox's Bazar resort town on Wednesday night and opened fire. Two of the victims died immediately and another was killed when the grenade exploded, police said, quoting Bangladeshi border guards. They said the attackers also abducted nine woodcutters. "We are not sure what prompted the pre-dawn attack," one officer of the Bangladesh Rifles said. "The situation in the area is very tense now," he said without explaining.
