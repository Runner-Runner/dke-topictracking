More than 700 Filipino children gathered on Thursday to air their views on a whole range of topics facing their country -- from sexual abuse to cruel teachers. One of five street children attending the First Filipino Children's Forum suggested a lack of educational opportunities could lead to children being sexually abused. "I would like to ask President (Fidel) Ramos to protect the children especially my friend who is illiterate and is easily duped by foreigners who abuse him sexually," 14-year old Gary Erasmas told Reuters Television. Erasmas and the other four are among Manila's thousands of street children who are easy prey for paedophiles. The Philippines has recently been cracking down on foreigners who come here for sex with children, jailing a Briton and an Australian. Other children from poor families complained they had to work too hard and urged the government to raise wages. "I hope government will listen to workers, especially teachers, like my mother, who are asking for higher wages," said Carmen Alamis, 14. Alamis works for 10 hours every weekend in a relative's printing press to augment her mother's salary. "This is the first time that we are listening from our children because in the past, we have always been lecturing to them," Education Secretary Ricardo Gloria told reporters. The children, aged from 10 to 16, also complained about educational problems such as crowded classrooms, a lack of books and abusive teachers. "I hope teachers who physically abuse their students will be removed from schools," said 12-year-old Raymond Rodriguez who said he had been hit on the head with a stick by an angry teacher.
