Foreign exchange speculative players are likely to renew their attack on the French franc next month by targeting a key level in the European Rate Mechanism's old band, U.S. experts said on Thursday. "The markets are ready to perceive the same kind of instability that we got in 1992 and 1993 surrounding Maastricht and the French budget," said international economist Mike Casey at MFR Inc. "You'll see increased pressure on the French franc next week when everybody is back from vacations," he added.   Traders in Paris said the Bank of France sold marks for French francs on Thursday as the franc neared the 3.4305 level -- the top of its ERM band until mid-1993. As usual, the Bank of France did not confirm nor deny the reported intervention. Speculative runs forced the British pound and the Italian lira to leave the ERM in 1992. Renewed attacks in the summer of 1993 -- this time centering on the French franc -- led the remaining ERM members to widen the ERM bands to 15 percent from 2.25 percent to discourage speculators. "The problem is the market perceives the French want the franc to enter the EMU within its old band," one trader said.
