Leftist rebels abducted three judicial officials in a rural area of northern Colombia and laid siege to a town in a mountainous area of the country's northwest overnight, authorities said on Thursday. A spokesman for the prosecutor-general's office said the kidnappings by National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels occurred on Wednesday in Meta province, in a remote area along the country's border with Venezuela. Police and army troops backed by helicopters were sent on Thursday to the municipality of Chiriguan where the kidnapping took place but there was no immediate word on the fate of the three men working for the prosecutor-general's elite police force, known as the Technical Investigations Unit. In other developments, about 200 rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), armed with mortars and rockets, attacked the small town of Peque in a rugged, mountainous area of northwestern Antioquia province, police and military officials said. They said the rebels, who launched their attack under cover of darkness at about midnight on Tuesday, destroyed the police station and other nearby buildings and knocked out a power plant and radio communications in an all-night firefight with a security force consisting of just 18 policemen. Three policemen were wounded in the attack. The rebel attack was the fourth on Peque since 1984. Army reinforcements arrived in the town early on Thursday but the rebels had already retreated into the surrounding countryside. The FARC and ELN are Colombia's largest and oldest rebel armies. They were founded in the mid-1960s and both specialise in kidnappings. The FARC also specialises in protection of rural drug farms and laboratories while the ELN is better known for its attacks against oil and coal installations.
