Cotton prices are likely to fall in Pakistan and India as crop arrivals increase, dealers said on Thursday. Dealers in Karachi said prices remained steady to higher in the week to Thursday on fears of crop damage after heavy rains and floods lashed parts of the cotton-producing Punjab province. But no significant damage was reported and dealers said supplies were on the rise. "There is no harm to the crop from rains and floods so far," Barkat Ali Soomro, vice president of the state's Pakistan Central Cotton Committee, said. Soomro said a crop of between 10.5 and 11 million 375-lb bales was expected in 1996/97 (July-June). Maqbool Sadiq, chirman of the Karachi Cotton Association (KCA), said rates for the NIAB-78 variety had gradually fallen to 2,300 rupees ($64.42) per maund (37.32 kg) from about 2,600 rupees two weeks ago. Prices could ease to 2,000 rupees by mid-September and could touch 1,900 rupees in October. On Thursday KCA spot rates, including a 10 percent sales tax, were steady at 2,645.50 rupees for NIAB-73, 2,508 for K-68 and 2,563 for MNH-93. In the kerb market NIAB-78 was traded in the range of 2,375 and 2,325 rupees per maund, dealers said. The KCA said customs-cleared exports had reached 1.825 million bales by July 31 since the 1995/96 picking season began on September 1. Imports had reached 47,545 480-lb bales by August 11. Following are the KCA's weekly cotton prices in rupees per maund ($1 = 35.70 rupees) - 					   Thursday     Previous     NIAB-78 (1996/97 crop)	 2,645.50     2,618     K-68    (1995/96 crop)	 2,508	  2,508     MNH-93  (1995/96 crop)	 2,563	  2,563 In India, cotton prices turned lower on the local market in the past week on news of fresh crop arrivals, dealers said. "Mill demand remained sluggish at the improved level while stockists were unloading stock following reports of commencement of new crop arrivals at the producing centres," a dealer said. India's Cotton Advisory Board (CAB) has estimated a cotton crop of 15.65 million 170-kg bales for 1995/96, compared to 13.85 million bales in 1994/95. The CAB has estimated cotton stocks at 3.60 million bales at the end of the current season. In spot deals Punjab F-414 fell by 15 rupees to 1,910/1,940 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) while Bengal-deshi moved down to 860/890 from 880/950 rupees per maund. Punjab saw-ginned, however, remained quiet at 1,675/1,700 rupees per maund while for forward delivery it was quoted at 1,650 rupees for October delivery and at 1,635 rupees for November, one broker said. "Gujarat varieties more or less remained steady during the week in a narrow price band," he said. "The Indian government allowed export of 1.5 million bales during the cotton year 1995/96 but hardly 50 percent of export quota has so far been shipped to the foreign buyers." He said the sluggish trend in the world market had kept Indian exports at a low ebb and the government had extended the validity of its export quota until October.
