CME pork belly futures closed down the daily limit of 2.000 cents per lb across the board on combined pressure from bearish charts and falling cash markets. Hog futures also ended lower on technical and fundamental selling sparked by declining cash, traders said. Pork bellies fell to five-week lows and were locked down the 2.000-cent limits most of the day with February ending at 80.050 cents, the third consecutive limit loss. Belly futures fell below the 40-day average Tuesday and charts now point to prices slipping into the mid 70-cent area. Falling cash markets will also press the market, traders said. Although new crop bellies will not be available until November 1, increased hog slaughter has provided added fresh belly supplies at a time when demand has fallen, they said. USDA said cash belly prices fell $7 to $11 per cwt Thursday with 14-16 lb bellies at $73.50, the lowest level since June 26. "They've (processors) lined up whatever supplies they need to put them through the balance of summer. They made commitments out ahead and did not do well this summer, as far as the bacon (price) was concerned, and now they need to make back some margin," said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Corp.   Levitt noted that the fresh belly market is falling because higher bacon prices this summer rationed demand, especially at retail which still accounts for 45 percent of the total consumption. Support may not develop in February until prices decline to the 74.000 to 76.000 cent area. There were 300 to 400 unfilled sell orders in February and options closed synthetically 1.650 cent lower. Hog futures were also pressured from declining cash prices. The sharp break in cash bellies will push cutout values down further after falling over $6 per cwt in 14 days of consecutive losses. The lean value index is also falling. "The lean value market is in a free fall and 51 to 52 percent lean, which is the basis for the new lean contracts, lost $2 today," Levitt said. Cash hogs are called $1 per cwt lower again Friday because packers are getting more hogs then they need and do not want to carry hogs over the extended Labor Day holiday weekend. Futures also look technically weak after penetrating last week's lows and falling to five-week lows, they added. Hog futures closed 0.950 to 0.025 cent lower with October off 0.775 at 52.400 cents per lb. --Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725
