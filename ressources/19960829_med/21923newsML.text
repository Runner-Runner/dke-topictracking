Germany's farm minister Jochen Borchert said he supported the marketing of genetically modified products in Europe as long as the EU agreed a labelling system to appease consumers. "I think it is necessary to agree on clear labelling at European levels to pre-empt consumer fears and to raise acceptance," he told Reuters after a harvest press conference on Thursday. The EU Commission in April approved imports from the U.S. of genetically modified soybeans as it found no evidence of health or environmental risks.   It said a segregation and special labellings were not needed but it would not stop member states applying national labelling regulations to the products derived from the beans. Trade and industry sources this week in Hamburg said they were worried about consumer reaction when the U.S. soybean imports arrive here late in 1996 as there had been too little time to carry out information campaigns. Borchert said he expected more applications for the marketing of genetically modified crops in the EU. Canada already grows genetically modified canola and EU producers want licences to market herbicide-resistant domestic rapeseed. "I expect that after the necessary investigations such products will also be approved, but that's why agreements on labelling are so important," Borchert said. -Vera Eckert, Bonn newsroom, +49-228-26097146
