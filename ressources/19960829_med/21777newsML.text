KCBT hard red winter wheat futures closed mixed amid heavy activity in both the intra- and intermarket spreads, traders said. Traders said players used the Dec/Sep spread to switch positions out of the front month ahead of Friday, which is first notice day for deliveries on KCBT Sept wheat. But buying of CBOT wheat on the intermarket spread was also evident amid feelings that KCBT HRW wheat may be overvalued relative to other U.S. wheat varieties in light of the improving world wheat production outlook, traders said. "Since KCBT wheat is the most expensive of all U.S. wheat... we could see even more weakness in here (relative to the other U.S. markets)," a KCBT trader said. KCBT wheat ended 6-3/4 cents per bushel lower to 2-1/2 cents higher, with Sep down 6-3/4 cents at $4.68-3/4. Dec lost 2-1/2 cents to close at $4.71. CIS and General Mills each bear-spread at least one million Dec/Sept bushels, traders said. KCBT said Thursday's estimated volume was 30.131 million, compared to 44.965 million Wednesday. --Greg Frost, 816 561-8671
