Peru's President Alberto Fujimori said he would lift from the beginning of November a ban on the importation of used cars in place since the end of January. The ban was originally intended to help ease Peru's large commercial deficit and the flooding of the local automobile market with imported used cars. But Fujimori, speaking late Wednesday, said he was overturning the ban to boost trade at Peru's southern port of Ilo. "What this measure looks for is that the $250 million reported annually through the importation of used vechicles comes in through (the port of) Ilo and not through the Chilean port of Iquique," he said. Fujimori also announced a new government project to create a commercial corridor between the southern cities of Matarani, Ilo and Tacna. The ban on car imports had brought angry protests in southern Peru earlier in the year due to a loss of business for traders and transporters. -- Andrew Cawthorne, Lima newsroom, 511 221-2134
