U.S. spot crudes closed Thursday on a strong note, finding support from short covering and developing fears of run cuts at refineries in the Caribbean as Hurricane Eduoard and Fran progress. Traders were especially keyed on the prospects the large Amerada Hess refinery in St Croix would be impacted. Backwardation between the October and November months ended the session at 53 cts, slightly wider than Wednesday, but narrowed from earlier levels above 60 cts. October West Texas Intermediate/Cushing ended at around $22.15-$22.25, 45-55 cts higher than the Wednesday close.
