Pakistan's Corporate Law Authority (CLA) said on Thursday it had seized phoney share applications worth 51 million rupees made at the initial public offering of Commercial Union Life Assurance (CULAP). "More than 10,000 share applications made through six different (bank) branches have been declared fictitious and subscription money amounting to 51.095 million rupees has been confiscated," the CLA said in a statement. CULAP, a subsidiary of Britain's Commercial Union Plc, had offered 10 million shares in May. The offer was oversubscribed six-fold. The applicants have a right to appeal, a CLA official said. CULAP launched its operations in July with an initial paid-up capital of 300 million rupees ($8.55 million) and plans to start individual life assurance and other products next year.
