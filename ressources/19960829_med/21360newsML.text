U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch will underwrite a 200 million litas ($50 million) bond issue on Lithuania's domestic market, a senior finance ministry official said on Thursday. The maturity will be one year and the proceeds will be used for general budget purposes, the official said. The issue will be in the local currency, the litas. The agreement between the Baltic state and Merrill Lynch could be signed on Thursday, the official said. "The bond will reduce borrowing costs on our domestic market and we hope that Merryl Lynch's participation will attract more foreign investors to our market," the official said. The cost of financing Lithuania's 700 million litas budget deficit rose sharply earlier this year in the wake of a banking crisis which drove T-bill rates up to almost 40 percent. Average yields have since fallen to almost 12 percent and the government received a $33 million syndicated loan in April on relatively favourable terms and is set to sign another for $75 million in September. Lithuania made its debut on the international bond market last December when it launched a $60 million Eurobond through Nomura with a two-year maturity and a coupon of 10 percent. --Riga Newsroom +3717-22 66 93
