Sri Lanka plans to import up to 400,000 tonnes of rice by the end of this year to meet a crop shortfall caused by drought and rising demand, government officials said on Thursday. "The (import) requirement this year is about 500,000 tonnes," a Food Commissioner's Department official said. "The private sector has already imported more than 100,000 tonnes in the first seven months of the year."   An Agriculture Ministry official said the shortfall caused by drought this year was about 300,000 tonnes in addition to the country's average annual rice shortage of aroud 200,000 tonnes. The ministry estimates the harvest this year will total about 1.3 million tonnes, he said. "Sri Lanka's normal annual production is around 1.5-1.7 million tonnes." The country had an exceptionally good rice harvest of 1.8 million tonnes in calendar 1995 when it imported only 9,000 tonnes. The government has invited tenders to import 30,000 tonnes of rice to help meet the anticipated shortfall in the local crop. More tenders are planned, the official said.
