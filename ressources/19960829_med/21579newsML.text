Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia) Ltd said on Thursday New World Development Co Ltd had completed the placement of 75 million existing shares at HK$37.10 per share globally. Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia chairman Gary Coull told Reuters the shares were placed out by the Cheng family, the controlling shareholders in New World. The placing of shares represented about 4.7 percent of the existing share capital. Coull also said the Cheng family would buy the same amount of shares at the same price. The effect would be a mild dilution of the Cheng family's shareholding in New World, Coull said. Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia is underwriter for the placement. The placement has been completed, Coull said. -- Donny Kwok, Hong Kong News Room (852) 2843 6441
