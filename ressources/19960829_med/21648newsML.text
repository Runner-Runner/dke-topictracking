Nippon Oil Co Ltd said on Thursday it would start up an advanced desulphurisation unit at its Negishi plant in Yokohama next Monday to meet a stringent standard on sulphur content in gas oil to be introduced next year. The 63,000 barrel per day unit is capable of cutting sulphur content in gas oil to below 0.05 percent, a Nippon Oil spokesman said. The government plans to lower the maximum allowable sulphur content in gas oil to 0.05 percent in October 1997 from the current 0.2 percent. Construction of the facility cost 14 billion yen. The other desulphurisation units at Nippon Oil's group refineries have already been revamped to meet the new standard, he added.
