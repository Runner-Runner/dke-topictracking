CSCE world sugar futures ended little changed Thursday, in quiet trade, in line with London white sugar which was also little changed. CSCE October sugar ended unchanged at 11.73 cents a lb, after trading in a 11.77-11.65 cent range. The October/March spread widened slightly to 37 cents. October sugar has been in an 11.40-11.90 cent range for nearly two months, after ralling from lows around 9.80 cents earlier this year.   "Recently the market has been bearish on forecasts of longer term supply, especially from Brazil," Refco analyst Anne Prendergast said. "But some well known houses have been reducing their forecasts of the supply/demand surplus this year to around 1.5 million tonnes from over 5.0 million earlier," she said. "In 13 of the past 15 years sugar prices usually decline in July but this year they did not, suggesting demand may be better than expected." "As a result the market has been protecting itself against a breakout with options and October's option open interest is high at 8,000 lots with only two weeks to expiry, so we could get some volatility," she said. In physical market news, Syria issued a new tender to buy 26,000 tonnes of white sugar and 26,000 tonnes of raws for October/November delivery to replace a cancelled tender. In other news, Egypt will be tendering for 25,000 tonnes of white sugar on September 4 and 25,000 of white or raw sugar on September 17. -- Clive McKeef, New York Commodities Desk + 1-212-859-1641
