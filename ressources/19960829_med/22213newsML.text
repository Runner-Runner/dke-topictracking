Duke Power Co's 846 megawatt (MW) Oconee nuclear power unit 3 in Seneca, S.C., is expected to return to full power tomorrow after operating at a reduced level since Sunday, the company said. "We are looking at returning to full power by tomorrow," company spokesman Guynn Savage said Thursday. Power at the unit was reduced Sunday evening after a feedwater pump tripped off line. On Wednesday, the unit was operating at 62 percent of capacity. Duke's 1,129 MW Catawba 1 nuclear unit in Clover, S.C., is expected to restart in mid-to-late September following a refueling outage, she added. -- New York Power Desk +212-859-1628
