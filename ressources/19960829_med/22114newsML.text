Investor Seymour Holtzman said Thursday he intends to nominate four individuals to be directors of First Financial Corp of Western Maryland at the company's annual meeting on October 24. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Holtzman said the nominees for a three-year term are himself, Janet Kemmet, John Schartiger and David Tressler. Holtzman, a stockholder rights advocate, said he does not seek control of the company. Holtzman, the largest individual shareholder of the Cumberland, Md.,-based thrift holding company with a stake of 8.19 percent, has persuaded the company to explore the possibility of a sale, but has rejected putting his nominees' names on the ballot at this year's annual meeting. Holtzman said he plans to begin soliciting proxies in favor of his slate and in opposition to management candidates as soon as he receives approval from the SEC to which he has filed a preliminary proxy statement. Last year, Holtzman lost a proxy fight to have his nominees elected.
