Authorities in southern China have busted 10 gangs that defrauded the government of export tax rebate payments, the Xinhua news agency said on Thursday. As part of a crackdown on financial crime, tax and security officials in booming Guangdong province had uncovered fake export tax rebate invoices with a combined face value of 1.9 billion yuan ($229 million), Xinhua said. Tax fraud is punishable by death in China. Separately, Guangdong authorities had recouped more than 3.0 million yuan ($361,000) in unpaid taxes since the campaign was launched early last year, the agency said. Police had arrested more than 100 people and seized $5.38 million in cash and a stash of valuables for a string of financial crimes, the agency said. It gave no further details. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)
