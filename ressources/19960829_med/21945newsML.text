Dutch-Belgian bank and insurance group Fortis said on Thursday it expected its U.S. accident and health insurance activities to at least achieve a break-even result in 1996. Co-chairman Hans Bartelds told a news conference that these U.S. activities had made a loss in the first half of 1996 of a few million European currency units (ECU). Fortis' worldwide health and accident activities posted an operating profit of 20 million ECU in the first half of 1996 after dipping to a loss of 23 million ECU in the final quarter of 1995 because of losses in Belgium and the U.S. Bartelds said Fortis had stopped selling group health insurance policies in the U.S. and was focusing instead on sales of health insurance to individuals. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
