An Israeli soldier was killed on Thursday when Moslem guerrillas shelled an Israeli position in south Lebanon, pro-Israeli militia sources said.   It was not immediately known if any soldiers were wounded in the attack on the strongpoint at Blat, one km (half a mile) from the Israeli border. Guerrillas continued shelling the strongpoint for more than an hour, and Israeli artillery hit back at suspected guerrilla positions, the sources said. In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) said its guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol near the Blat position, killing or wounding several soldiers. It said fighting continued for more than an hour.
