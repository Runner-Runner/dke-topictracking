Prosecutors in the Oklahoma City bombing case claimed Thursday that accused bomber Timothy McVeigh was hoping to influence potential jurors in his trial by holding a string of media interviews. Although they did not specifically ask U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch to bar McVeigh from holding interviews, the prosecution attorneys said his plan to do so was "an extraordinary attempt to manipulate the news media to produce a favourable impact on the potential jury pool." Attorney Sean Connelly said any interviews would hinder an impartial trial and that McVeigh's taxpayer-paid lawyers had no authority to make ordinary citizens foot the bill for their public relations efforts to improve McVeigh's image. McVeigh last week asked for court permission to give eight jailhouse interviews of his choice to counter any public perception that he is a "demon." His attorneys said the interviews were necessary because "the government and the press has succeeded in convincing the public that not only is Timothy McVeigh guilty, but he deserves to die." McVeigh and former army buddy Terry Nichols are the only two people accused of planting the bomb which ripped apart the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, that claimed at least 168 lives. Connelly said in a written response to McVeigh's request for permission to hold interviews that "the best way to ensure fairness is for the case to proceed to trial as quickly as possible, not to attempt to increase the volume of publicity." He said the prosecution team will ask Matsch "to set the earliest possible trial date" after he decides whether Nichols and McVeigh should be tried separately, as they requested. McVeigh granted four interviews before authorities at the prison where he is being held told his lawyers to get the judge's permission for future interviews.
