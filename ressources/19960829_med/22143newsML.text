President Bill Clinton plans to unveil proposals to move people from welfare to work and to expand a capital gains tax exclusion when he accepts the Democratic party's presidential nominaton on Thursday. Following are some of the details of the proposals, based on a briefing by White House economic aide Gene Sperling, who spoke to reporters travelling with the president in Chicago. The president will put forward a $3.43 billion initiative designed to move people from welfare to jobs in three ways:   -- giving employers who hire a welfare recipient who has been on Aid to Families with Dependent Children for at least 18 months a tax credit worth up to $5000, or 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages, child or health care and training provided to the employee; -- a $3 billion welfare-to-jobs initiative to be given to states or local authorities for them to work with the private sector and non-profit agencies to create job opportunities for long-term welfare recipients; the money will be given directly to the 100 to 150 communities with the highest concentration of long-term welfare recipients; for other communities, the money will be administered by the state governor. -- a tax credit for people who make equity investments in community development banks, or other community financial institutions. The president also plans to to propose extending the home sellers capital gains tax exemption in an initiative that will cost a total of $1.4 billion. Under current law, people over the age of 55 can claim a one-time tax exclusion of $125,000 on the sale of a home. The new proposal would eliminate the age limit and would increase the tax exclusion to $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for a couple filing their income taxes jointly. Both of the initiatives will be paid for by revenue raising measures previously disclosed by the White House.
