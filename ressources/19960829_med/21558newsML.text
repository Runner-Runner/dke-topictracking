Tokyo rubber futures ended easier on Thursday as prices gave up early gains on long-liquidation by private investors ahead of the close, traders said. Prices ranged from 0.9 yen per kg lower to unchanged. Benchmark February stood 0.5 yen lower at 142.9 yen. Higher prices in producing countries prompted buying, particularly in distant months, in early afternoon, but cautious sentiment over the high prices surfaced in the market ahead of the close. "Given an expected increase in rubber stocks, any price upside could be capped at 145 yen for the benchmark February," an analyst at a commodity broker said.
