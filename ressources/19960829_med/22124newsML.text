Wisconsin Energy Corp said Thursday a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission law judge conditionally approved the company's merger with Northern States Power Co to form Primergy Corp. In his initial decision, Administrative Law Judge Michel Levant found that establishment of an independent system operator will serve to migitage any anti-competitive effects of the merger. Levant's decision, while not binding on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is significant since it will be considered by them in deliberations on the merger. The two utilities announced their intent to merge on May 1, 1995. The Michigan public service commissions approved the merger in April and the North Dakota commission did so in June. A final decision by the FERC Commissioners is expected by yearend. 	  -- Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787
