Salomon Brothers said Thursday it thought French tobacco company Seita would fail in its lawsuit against the firm over losses suffered on a series of swaps transactions. Earlier, lawyers for Seita confirmed that the company had filed suit in a New York state court, charging Salomon with negligence and breach of contract. The suit refers to $29 million in losses Seita said it suffered as a result of swaps transactions in 1994. A federal court has already dismissed a similar suit on jurisdictional grounds. A Salomon spokesman said the firm expected the state court claim would also prove fruitless. "We think that their claim will fail again," said Salomon spokesman Robert Baker. "Seita is an experienced and sophisticated market participant who is trying to use the courts to reverse a losing trade." Baker said he could not comment further on specifics of the lawsuit. -- Wall Street desk, 212 859-1730
