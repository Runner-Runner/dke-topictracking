Dutch-Belgian financial group Fortis said on Thursday it expected net profits for the whole of 1996 to show a rise of at least 10 percent. Fortis said its two parent companies -- Fortis Amev and Fortis AG -- both expected growth in full-year 1996 earnings per share of at least seven percent. Fortis said that in the second half of this year it did not expect to equal the exceptionally high banking profits achieved in the same period of 1995, but that its insurance business would post a further increase in profits. "Barring unforeseen circumstances and strong fluctuations in currency and interest rates, Fortis expects for the whole of 1996 a rise in net profits of at least 10 percent," it said. "Both Fortis parent companies are raising their forecast. They expect for the whole of 1996 a rise in earnings per share of at least seven percent," it added. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
