The demand outlook is favourable for paper grades produced by Finnish forest industry companies, Finnish Forest Industries Federation head Matti Korhonen said on Thursday. "Globally and in Europe, the outlook is best for printing and writing papers with consumption seen rising by slightly more than four percent per year," Korhonen said in a prepared speech. "As this product category is central for the Finnish paper industry, the demand prospects can be regarded as quite favourable from our point of view," he said. High-quality printing and writing papers account for nearly 60 percent of Finnish paper production while newsprint's share is 13 percent. in Sweden, the corresponding figures are 22 percent and 26 percent respectively, Korhonen said. He said European integration would change structures in the paper industry. "Company acquisitions will increase and the paper industry will be concentrated into still bigger entities," he said. Finland's three biggest forest industry firms now account for 90 percent of the sector's net sales compared to less than 30 percent one decade ago, he noted. He saw scope for bigger entities in the mechanical forest industry. "In the future, Finland should...increase the size and level of refinement of its mechanical forest industry to that of Europe's leading countries," Korhonen said. --Helsinki Newsroom  +358 - 0 - 680 50 245
