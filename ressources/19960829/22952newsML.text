Spain's Banco de Santander is looking for more business opportunities in Eastern Europe having bought a stake in a private Hungarian bank, a spokesman for the bank said on Wednesday. Santander is also studying expansion possibilities for its German unit CC-Bank Moenchengladbach in East Germany, as well as in the Czech Republic and Poland, he added. A month ago Santander bought almost five percent of Hungarian bank Inter-Europa Bank for which it has an option to increase the stake to 9.9 percent before year-end. "It was a relatively small operation. But we consider it a starting point for opportunities in Eastern Europe," the spokesman said. Inter-Europa Bank is a high street bank, also licensed for corporate and private clients. In April Santander increased its stake in CC-Bank to 100 percent from 50 percent, paying 25 billion pesetas. -- Madrid newsroom +341 585 2160
