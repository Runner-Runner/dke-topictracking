Within hours of receiving tentative regulatory approval to resume operations, ValuJet Inc said it expects to return to the skies within 30 days with a smaller fleet and slightly higher costs. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration returned the carrier's operating certificate Thursday after a review found ValuJet corrected maintenance and operation failings that led to its grounding in June. The Transportation Department, the FAA's parent agency, also said that ValuJet had sufficient funds and management expertise to resume flying.   While ValuJet's president and chief operating officer Lewis Jordan said he could not forecast when the discount carrier would begin flying, but said it was "highly conceivable" that flights would resume within seven to 30 days. ValuJet was grounded following a May 11 crash in the Florida Everglades that killed 110 people. Regulators said interested parties have seven days to challenge ValuJet's fitness. The carrier would then have four days to respond to those comments.   The Department of Transportation will review the comments before issuing final flight approval, ValuJet said. "We expect a lot of opposition, we expect a lot of comments to flow in during the public comment period and we will deal with each and every one of those concerns," Jordan told employees and reporters during a news conference. Since its grounding, ValuJet said it had added additional training programs, adjusted its organizational structure and fine-tuned its overall operations.   Based on the recommendation of its "safety czar" Gen. J.B. Davis, Jordan said the company will add a new position -- director of safety -- to lead a team of professionals focused on maintenance and safety. Davis, who was hired by ValuJet following the crash of Flight 592 to inspect the carriers' safety policy and procedures, will remain with the airline until October, Jordan said. ValuJet will resume operations with a smaller fleet, starting with nine aircraft initially, then adding six more aircraft over the next few days.   ValuJet previously operated a fleet of 51 aircraft. When the airline returns to service, flying from Atlanta to five destinations, its costs will be higher over the short term, Jordan said. Jordan expects ValuJet's costs per available seat mile to rise to $0.07, compared with $0.0695 at the end of the 1996 first quarter. Jordan declined to comment on ValuJet's current financial position, saying instead that regulators found that ValuJet had sufficient funds to resume flying.   The company previously said it had $208 million in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, compared with $254 million at the end of the first quarter. Jordan, one of the carrier's top executives that has come under attack for alleged mismanagement, also highlighted some the DOT's findings, which supported the airline's management. "The background and experience of ValuJet's management team fully qualifies them to oversee the carrier's operations," the DOT findings said.   Jordan also said the DOT indicated that there was no reason to remove him or ValuJet's chairman Robert Priddy, finding that the "ValuJet management team has the managerial expertise and technical expertise necessary to oversee operations." The Association of Flight Attendants has lobbied to oust the ValuJet executives, saying there are incompetent and unfit to run the airline. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610
