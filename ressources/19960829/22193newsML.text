COMEX copper settled higher though the market failed to keep much of the day's gains despite news that workers at Codelco's Salvador mine would strike from midnight, earlier than planned. "The market is just flatlining, but I'm neutral to slightly bullish," an LME and COMEX broker said. Union officials at Salvador said they would strike from midnight (0400 GMT) unless Codelco restarted talks. The union will hold an assembly at 1800 EDT Thursday. December COMEX settled 0.50 cent higher at 90.70 cents, traded 91.80 to 90.20 cents. Spot September went out 0.45 cent higher at 91.50 cents. The market was waiting for Friday's LME stock report which covers two reporting periods. There was no stock report Tuesday because of the U.K. public holiday Monday. Economic data released Thursday showed that July sales of new single family homes in the U.S. - an important copper consuming sector - rose sharply, up 7.9 percent to an annual rate of 783,000 units. A rate of 728,000 was forecast. COMEX copper trading ends one hour early at 1300 EDT on Friday ahead of the Labor Day weekend. COMEX and NYMEX are closed on Monday. -- Huw Jones, New York Commodities 212-859-1646
