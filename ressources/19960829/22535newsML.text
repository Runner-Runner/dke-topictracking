Jordan overnight dinar rates fluctuated on Thursday with morning transactions concluded at 3.50 percent before easing to 2.00 percent in afternoon deals, dealers said. Dealers said demand dropped in the afternoon with less bank borrowing on a usually quiet Thursday, the start of the local weekend. Rates were around 3.00-4.00 percent Wednesday. Bankers attributed a depressed market this week, with rates at a 3.00 percent average, to the start of monthly salary transfers by ministries and public institutions to the banking system, along with weaker subsription in last week's 15 million dinar CD auction. Some dealers expect a tighter market at the start of weekly trade on Saturday as the latest CD issue absorbs some liquidity. -- Amman newsroom takes queries on +962 6 623 776
