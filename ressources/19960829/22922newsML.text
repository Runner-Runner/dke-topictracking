Vietnam reported a sharply wider trade gap of $3.246 billion on Thursday for the period from January 1 to August 10 and said problems in foreign investment policy were a prime cause. The Government Statistics Office said exports in the period reached $3.872 billion and imports $7.118 billion, representing a spectacular increase from the $2.159 billion figure reported in July. The office said a major factor behind the gap was imports of equipment and materials for projects involving foreign direct investment which had begun production but were yet to achieve full output and export returns. Imports for the sector were put at $1.108 billion and exports at $432 million, with a resultant deficit of $676 million. "Although the deficit has not yet had a big impact it is necessary to review the licensing of foreign investments so that a balance can be maintained between infrastucture projects and industries with long production cycles and others where production is more rapid," the office said in a statement. Vietnam's trade deficit in 1995 stood at $2.3 billion and a trade ministry official said as recently as last month that the gap was expected to widen to $3.4-$3.5 billion this year. Foreign investors have earmarked some $21 billion for projects in Vietnam since economic reforms and an open-door policy were introduced in the late 1980s. But Hanoi, eager to increase its control over the sector, announced at its recent national Communist Party Congress that it would take a more selective approach to the issuing of licences. Government officials say the aim is to channel investment towards specific areas in order to maximise benefits to the national economy.
