French protein pea producers have revised up their national yield estimates by seven percent after a strong harvest in the north of France. UNIP, the French protein producers' federation, said on Thursday it estimated the average field pea yield at 4.8 tonnes per hectare in 1996 compared with last year's 4.86 tonnes. Before the harvest, which is now finished, the group had projected a slide in yields to 4.5 tonnes because of drought in the central and eastern growing regions. As with grain, strong yields in northern France just about made up for the drop in drought-affected areas. In a note to operators, UNIP predicted a French harvest of some 2.5 million tonnes based on the slight yield loss and a drop in area to 534,000 hectares from 566,000 hectares. Last year's harvest was 2.75 million tonnes. Yields touched six tonnes per hectare this year in two northern regions, Picardie and Nord-Pas-de-Calais, UNIP said. Lowest yields were in Burgundy, eastern France, where the field pea crop produced just 3.8 tonnes per hectare compared with 4.48 tonnes in 1995. -- Paris newsroom 6331 4221 5146
