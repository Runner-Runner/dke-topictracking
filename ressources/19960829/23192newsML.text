Kwangju Bank has mandated KDB Asia to arrange its first floating rate note issue, bankers said on Thursday. They said the US$50 million FRN had a final maturity of three years with no put or call options. The issue would be priced at par to float at 45 basis points over the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate. Fees had not been decided yet. An arranger group of four to five banks was being sought. General syndication would start in early or mid-September. --Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2847 4039
