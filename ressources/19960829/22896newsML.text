Rolls-Royce said on Thursday it was confident over future prospects after one-off charges pushed its first-half results into the red, and backed its optimism with the announcement of a major new aircraft engine order. "The immediate outlook is steady and, with the introduction of new products over the next few years, the company is confident of achieving future growth," Rolls-Royce said in a statement. The company reported a first half loss of 169 million pounds ($263 million) compared with a 70 million pound profit a year ago, due to exceptional charges of 248 million. The charges relate to Rolls-Royce's earlier decision to pull out of the loss-making large steam power generation business. The first-half results matched analysts' expectations. Rolls-Royce said the results showed the underlying strength of its aerospace group. "Our decision to withdraw from large steam power generation recognises the need to focus upon those businesses where we have established or can establish leading market positions," chairman Sir Ralph Robins said. Sales from continuing operations rose to 1.77 billion pounds from 1.49 billion pound. The order book stood at 7.0 billion at the half year, up from 6.5 billion a year earlier. In a separate statement, it said that it had received an order worth up to $450 million to power a batch of Russian-built Tupolev airliners from the Kato Group of Egypt. Rolls said that its aerospace group had made good progress in the military business as well as in commercial markets where it continues to develop a broad and competitive portfolio of aircraft engines. Rolls-Royce shares fell two pence to 229-1/2 in pre-market trading. ($1=.6421 Pound)
