Mexico's stock market closed sharply lower on Thursday, buffeted by rebel attacks in two southern Mexican states and a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The market's main index closed down 2.226 percent or 75.94 points to 3,334.90 points. "It was a combination of factors, and even without the guerrillas, there were external factors that would have affected the stock market, as much in Mexico as in the United States," said Claudio Brocado, director of analysis with Valores Finamex in New York.   At least 13 people were killed overnight when scores of masked rebels struck police and military posts in Oaxaca and Guerrero states in the most serious guerrilla assaults in Mexico in more than two years. The attacks, which appeared to be closely coordinated, were in six towns in Guerrero and Oaxaca states. The Mexican bolsa was also rattled by economic factors. The rise in the yield on the U.S. 30 Treasury bond, which climbed to 7.04 percent after a hefty upward revision in U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product, hurt Mexican stocks.   The Dow Jones average fell 64.73 points to 5,647.65 points. "Local investors were the most nervous due to the political signifigance. People started to say the attack was tied to the upcoming state of the union address more than to social concerns," said one analyst. President Ernesto Zedillo will give his annual state of the union address on Sunday. Among the biggest losers in Mexico were Tribasa, down 7.58 percent or 1.50 pesos to 18.30 pesos.   Grupo Financiero BBVProbursa series B shed 12.12 percent or eight centavos to 58 centavos in heavy trading ahead of a secondary offer of BBV International Investment. One of the few gainers was Grupo Financiero Banorte A, up 2.86 percent, or 20 centavos, to 7.20 pesos. Volume was 110,214,185, with 76 stocks declining, nine gaining and 15 unchanged. -- Mexico City newsroom (525) 728 9559
