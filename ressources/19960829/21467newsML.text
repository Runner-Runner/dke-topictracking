Venezuelan industry is optimistic an upturn in the recession-bound local economy is coming soon, a survey carried out by business chamber Coindustria showed, but that upbeat outlook is yet to translate into increased industrial activity. "The survey's essential message is that expectations are improving -- despite the severe recession," Coindustria president Pedro Carmona told a news conference. "What still hasn't materialized are significant increases in investment, production or in the use of installed industrial capacity," he added.   The cross-sector survey polled 450 businesses and compared responses to a similar survey carried out in the first quarter of 1996. Over half of polled companies said they felt optimistic, or very optimistic, about the next twelve months. However more than 50 percent also expected production to stay flat, or fall, over the next three months. The survey also showed overwhelming private sector support for Venezuelan integration into the Mercosur trade zone -- although in conjunction with Venezuela's Andean partners and not alone. -- John Paul Rathbone, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
