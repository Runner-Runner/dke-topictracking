Petrol price wars among supermarkets and major oil companies continue to make conditions tough in that area, Dino Adriano, deputy chief executive of J. Sainsbury Plc, said in an interview with Reuters. "One of the characteristics at the moment, with food retailers, is the very tough conditions that exist on petrol," he said. "Most (supermarkets) are into petrol stations and no-one's making any money on this at present," he added. Adriano said some people were "definitely losing money," but added that "hopefully the situation will stabilise before long."   Supermarkets and oil companies have been vying to offer cheap petrol since Esso launched its PriceWatch campaign earlier this year. ASDA, which prides itself on offering cheapest prices of the big four supermarkets, said in May that it would sell "profit-free" petrol. Supermarkets currently account for 20-25 percent of UK petrol sales. Adriano added that overall conditions for food retailers remained competitive. -- Jo Winterbottom, London Newsroom +44 171 5427717
