New Zealand Refining Ltd said on Thursday that since June 1996, as new refining capacity has come on stream in South East Asia, margins have come under pressure and weakened again to 1995 levels. "These factors together with the extended scheduled shutdown of "A" block later in November will likely reduce the profitability compared with the first half of the year," it said in a statement to the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The company earlier reported a year net profit of NZ$27.6 million, up 99 percent on the previous year's profit of NZ$13.8 million.   Cavalier said robust refining margins in the second quarter had given a significant boost to income compared with the same period in 1995. It said the rise in net profit for the first half year was largely attributed to the strong refining margins, particularly in April and May. However, production had been affected by two shutdowns resulting in lower throughput of 2.07 million (1995 2.47 million tonnes) for the six month period. Cavalier said the capital expenditure programme outlined in the company's annual report was proceeding, with the major project, the crude distiller 1/platformer revamp, on schedule.   "Tie-ins to the existing A block plant will be completed during the scheduled shutdown in November 1996," it said. --Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746
