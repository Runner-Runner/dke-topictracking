Russian platinum shipments to Japan under long-term contracts are expected to return to normal gradually after delays of up to three weeks, precious metal industry officials said on Thursday. Platinum shipments from Russia for August delivery have been suspended by up to three weeks. "The Russian platinum export agency has informed us it will deliver platinum for August shipment at the end of August," a trader at a major trading house said. Russian shipments started to be delayed in July, and July delivery arrived in Japan after delays of up to one month.   Industry officials said that the Russian platinum export agency did not reveal the reason behind the delays. The recent delays had spooked the Japan's precious metal industry, fueling concerns over Russian platinum stockpiles. Russia's platinum shipment for August is estimated at about two tonnes. There had been expectations that the domestic platinum market could become tighter if the delayed shipments were prolonged and platinum demand rose with the approach of seasonal year-end demand from the jewellery sector, but now those concerns eased, they said.   Japan is the world largest consumer of platinum and Russia and South Africa are its main suppliers. Japan imported 6.92 tonnes of platinum in July, and of that, 1.77 tonnes came from Russia, Finance Ministry data showed. There have been no delays in Russian palladium shipments to Japan or in platinum shipments from South Africa, they said. Russian trade representatives in Tokyo could not immediately be reached for comment.
