Edouard has top winds of 125 mph and is expected to maintain this strength while turning more to the northwest during the day today. The current forecast track out through Saturday takes the storm northwest then north to a position between Bermuda and the USA East Coast. This track will keep the storm over open water, making it a threat to shipping, but with the forecast track still somewhat uncertain, interests from the Bahamas to the USA East Coast to Bermuda need to monitior the progress of Edouard.

Fran is expected to conitnue this motion during today, possibly intensifying into a hurricane.
