The main growth for Rolls-Royce is in civil aircraft engine orders, but chairman Sir Ralph Robins said it was too early yet to make firm predictions on future prospects in this market segment. "The airlines have had many years of loss-making and now they are in the second year of making profits, so I am slightly cautious how long this improvement continues," he told Reuters in an interview. "But there is no doubt there is much more activity than there was last year," Robins added, while speaking on engine orders for civil aircraft in the first half of 1996.   Rolls-Royce earlier reported a first-half loss of 169 million pounds following exceptional charges of 248 million. The charges relate to Rolls' decision to withdraw from large steam power generation. The company had posted a profit of 70 million pounds a year ago. Separately, Rolls-Royce announced it had won a $450 million order to power Russian-built airliners from Egypt's Kato Group. "There is a lot of activity in the civil business. We are seeing growth everywhere," Robins said. "We are negotiating with airlines throughout the world for our whole range of products," he added.   Robins said spares orders had continued to increase in the first half as airlines had begun to re-stock after a long period in which they ran down their stocks. "We may be seeing around 10 percent (spares order growth)," he said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
