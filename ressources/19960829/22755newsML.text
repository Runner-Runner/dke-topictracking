Greek depos and forex swaps were caught off guard and tumbled 20 to 25 basis points on the central bank's surprise cut in its overnight bid rate, dealers said. "The timing of the cut caught the market by surprise and rates plummeted 20 to 25 basis points across-the-board," said a dealer at a foreign bank. The Bank of Greece cut its intervention bid in overnight funds by 20 basis points to 12.40 percent on slower July M3 and credit growth. It had slashed its intervention bid by 20 bp to 12.60 percent last week on the back of Buba's repo rate cut.   M3 growth fell to 8.3 year-on-year in July from 9.0 percent in June, within the central bank's 6.0-9.0 percent target zone. "After taking into consideration the latest figures on M3 and credit expansion growth which show a marked slowdown, the central bank decided to slash its intervention bid in overnight funds by 20 basis points to 12.40 percent," a high-level central bank official told Reuters. Dealers said the central bank's move aimed to discourage inflows through forex swaps that have augmented interbank liquidity and to help the finance ministry's T-bill issue on Monday. "It is obvious that the Bank of Greece wants to reduce interest rate differentials and help halt forex inflows that have inflated liquidity," said a dealer at a state bank. "The move will help the T-bill issue which looks more attractive now." The September 2 T-bill issue will feature a 10 basis point cut in rates. The 12-month, six-month and three-month T-bills will fall to 12.70 percent, 12.10 percent and 11.90 percent respectively. Other traders said the central bank's cut was a signal that interest rates were heading lower and some predicted that long tenors could drop by 100 to 150 basis points by year-end. "Yields sink and this will continue," said a senior dealer at a private bank. "A drop of 100 to 150 basis points in longer periods is on the cards by end-96." Early elections are to be held on September 22 but the market has taken a positive attitude towards them on the grounds that the winner will have no option but to follow Greece's EU convergence plan. The mark was quoted at 160.08/13 drachmas from Thursday's 160.140 fix, the dollar at 236.55/65 drachmas from 236.460 and the Ecu at 301.07/17 from 301.130 drachmas. "Ecu/drachma rose above the 301 level," said a forex dealer at a foreign bank. "About 40 million ecus were bought at today's fixing as players sought to lock in profits as part of the classic swap play."
