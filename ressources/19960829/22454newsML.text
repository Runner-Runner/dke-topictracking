Sir Colin Hope, chairman of automotive components and engineering group T&N Plc, on Thursday firmly ruled out any possibility of a rights issue should the company succeed with its planned purchase of German piston producer Kolbenschmidt AG (KS). "I would (say) firmly that there is no question of a rights issue in financing that acquisition in the foreseeable future," Hope told a news conference after the firm's half-year results. Regulatory hurdles and investigations by the German cartel office have held up T&N's proposed purchase of KS but Hope said the company is now more optimistic of success. Since March 1995, T&N has had an option on nearly 50 percent of KS's shares, currently owned by Commerzbank AG. It continues to pay the carrying costs of these options which remain in place in their present form until December 31. Hope said that structural changes in the German components sector that altered the competitive situation seemed to be in T&N's favour and he hinted that the European regulatory playing field may also be tilting more towards the British company. "We're substantially more confident that we're on the way now than we were 12 months ago," he said. -- Andrew Huddart, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 8716
