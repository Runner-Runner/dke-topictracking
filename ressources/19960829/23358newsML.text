The decrease in six-month profitability resulted mainly from a decline in profits from financing activity and an increase in operating and other expenses, said Hapoalim, Israel's largest financial group. A reduction in the provision for doubtful debts and an increase in extraordinary transactions partially offset these developments. Contributing to the decline in financing profit was a provision for the writedown in the value of the bank's portfolio of marketable bonds, following a drop in their price. The slight rise in six-month operating income resulted from a 5.6 percent growth in commission income. Increased customer activity contributed to higher income, especially from computerised services, foreign trade activity and special foreign currency services. However, income from capital market activity decreased 13 percent. Shareholder's equity at the end of June totalled $2.3 billion, up 5.5 percent over the end of 1995. Total consolidated assets were 145.2 billion shekels against 145.3 billion at the end of 1995. Deposits from the public were 95.6 billion shekels on June 30, up from 94.7 billion at the end of 1995 while credit granted to the public stood at 87.4 billion shekels against 86.3 billion at the end of 1995. The bank said net assets of the 25 provident funds -- long-term savings funds with special tax benefits -- it manages fell to 33 billion shekels on June 30 from 34.3 billion at the end of 1995.
