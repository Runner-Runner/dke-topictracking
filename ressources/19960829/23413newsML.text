French conglomerate Groupe Lagardere seeks to retain 60 percent of the capital of Thomson-CSF if it wins the bidding in Thomson SA's privatisation, newspapers reported on Thursday. Noel Forgeard, chairman of Lagardere's Matra Defense Espace unit, said Matra's assets would be transferred to Thomson-CSF, to create Thomson-Matra which would be controlled by Groupe Lagardere but would be a company in its own right and continue to be quoted on the Paris bourse, business daily Les Echos said. British Aerospace Plc could hold up to five percent in Thomson-Matra and Thomson staff between five to six percent.   Les Echos said, apart from the state's "golden share", Lagardere would control "at least 60 percent of the new entity." British Aerospace's (BAe) proposed stake would be a symbolic one as Lagardere was not in need of funds, it quoted Forgeard as saying. BAe had been initially slated for a 15 percent holding. Absent from the list of proposed shareholders were General Electric Co Plc (GEC) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa), which Forgeard had previously announced as partners in the Thomson bid. These had been dropped due to opposition from the French authorities, but could enter alliances in, respectively, radars and missiles, it said. Lagardere has earmarked more than 10 billion francs to pay down Thomson SA's debt and to buy the 42 percent of Thomson-CSF shares in public hands, the report said. Matra would transfer its Matra BAe Dynamics, Matra Cap Systeme, Matra Communications, Matra Datavision and Matra Marconi Space to Thomson-CSF, thus maintaining CSF's six existing divisions and create a seventh with the satellite activities of Matra Marconi Space. La Tribune Desfosses newspaper said the outcome of the bids should be known in six to eight weeks. Engineering and power group Alcatel Alsthom is also bidding for Thomson SA. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
