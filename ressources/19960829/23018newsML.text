The Australian share market meandered to a weaker close on Thursday, having spent the day trapped in a 10 point range with little incentive to attempt escape. July balance of payments figures, one possible market motivator, came in on expectations and was promptly ignored. By 4.30 p.m. (0630 GMT), the All Ordinaries index had closed 4.9 points down at 2279.3. September share index futures closed five points lower at 2279, a 0.3 point discount to the index. Turnover ended at impressive levels as August series options reached expiry.   While the market came off its lows in the afternoon, players said they had little to work with, resulting in the day's basically flat performance. "It improved in the afternoon. Commonwealth Bank led the way back even though BHP went into reverse," said broker Kevin Lourey of Peake Lands Kirwan. "There is no real reason for it to be as flat as it is. Volumes are quite good." Others traders agreed, saying the market had been essentially rudderless with the options expiry probably as strong a force as any on the day.   "There was not much to work with and that is exactly what it did - not much," said a Sydney-based dealer. "Options-related trade accounted for a lot of the business and the balance of payments surprised no-one." Strongest performance of the day came from gas utility, AGL, whose shares streaked to record highs, fuelled by a record full year net profit of A$124.3 million. Other companies to report included minerals sands and base metals miner, RGC, which posted a 46.6 percent rise in full year net profit to A$142.81 million. Its shares closed fractionally firmer.   Base metals miner Aberfoyle closed unchanged after a 44 percent plunge in full year net profit to A$8.88 million. Shopping centre operator Westfield Holdings lost ground despite a 21.9 percent higher full year net profit of A$74.94 million. Shares in insurer MMI ended weaker despite a slightly higher full year net profit of A$35.3 million while automotive parts manufacturer GUD Holdings ended unchanged after a marginally higher full year net profit of A$10.63 million.   Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about 11 to 10, while about 31 percent of stocks traded remained steady. In other local markets, bond prices pressed against upside resistance as the market attempted to retrace its steps after the steep sell-off earlier in the week. By 4.35 p.m. (0635 GMT), the 10 year T-bond was at 8.06, down 0.04 from Wednesday. The Australian dollar hit a six-week high Thursday as broad-based buying and a benign current account reading helped it penetrate stiff resistance. By 4.45 pm (0645 GMT) the local dollar had dug in at US$0.7932/37, having advanced from an early US$0.7910/15 and Wednesday's late US$0.7905/10.   FUTURES/OPTIONS - Futures trading displayed the same aimless behaviour as the underlying market and saw average activity levels. Options trade boomed, driven by the close out of the August series options.
