South Korea's consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.3 percent in August year on year, up from a 3.5 percent rise a year earlier, Ministry of Finance and Economy figures showed on Thursday. 					    Aug     July	Aug 95     CPI (pct, yr-on-yr)	    +5.3     +5.6	+3.5     CPI (pct, month-to-month)    +0.2     +0.4	+0.5     CPI (base=1990)		 143.2    142.9     136.0 A ministry official said the year-on-year CPI growth in August was higher than a year earlier as cooler than usual weather conditions early this year boosted prices for agricultural products. A rise in oil product prices and transportation costs was also behind the rise, he said. "But this month's increase from last month was quite small despite a rise in public bus fares as agricultural product prices stabilised thanks to a better harvest," he said. "If the weather conditions stay favourable, prices of agricultural goods will remain stable for the time being."   The official said the CPI rose 4.4 percent for the first eight months of this year, just slightly off the year's 4.5 percent target. The CPI, South Korea's leading inflation indicator, rose 4.7 percent in the whole of 1995, down from a 5.6 percent rise in 1994, the ministry said. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5643
