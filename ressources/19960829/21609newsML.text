Malaysian rubber prices extended gains at the close on further short-covering in SMR 10 and 20, dealers said. They said a weaker Tokyo futures market failed to reverse the current uptrend in local rubber prices. "There is still covering of the 10 and 20 by local dealers for earlier sales to the Middle East and China," said one dealer. Traders said producers were also slightly reserved as the current wet weather was beginning to pressure supply of raw materials into the market.   At the close, benchmark September RSS1 buyer was quoted at 329.50 cents ($1.32) a kg by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board, up one cent from Wednesday. September SMR20 buyer was up two cents at 312.50 cents ($1.25) a kg. Trading houses offered the SMR20 at 312 cents, SMR10 at 313, SMR5 at 325, SMR CV at 375, SMR L at 350 and drum latex FOB at 248. The INRO five-day average rose to 246.74 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on Aug 28 from 245.86 on Aug 27. The daily indicator rose to 249.78 from 247.57. ($1=2.4940 ringgit)
