Germany's Audi AG said Thursday its group pre-tax profit rose 58 percent to 405 million marks ($273.8 million) as foreign sales expanded amid a downturn in the German market. Audi said worldwide sales rose to 9.3 billion marks ($6.3 billion) from 8.2 billion marks ($5.5 billion) in the 1995 period as 246,597 vehicles were sold, a rise of 6.3 percent over the 1995 six-month period. Foreign vehicles sales rose to 55 percent of total sales from 51 percent in year-ago period, reflecting strong demand. But sales in Germany fell 2.1 percent to 110,262 vehicles. The carmaker, invigorated by its award-winning A4 vehicles, said its share of the German car market in the first half of the year fell to 5.8 percent from 6.4 percent. Management Board Chairman Herbert Demel said Audi's nominal German market share would likely fall in 1996 to about 6 percent from 6.3 percent in 1995. But he expected 1996 sales to climb more than 5 percent and said 1996 would be "a strong year" in Germany. He noted that 1995 was "an even stronger year" in the domestic market due to the new the A4. Seeking to expand its international presence, he said Audi will announce in a few years plans for two or three foreign finishing plants but has ruled out a U.S. plant for now. "You can be sure that plans for two or three new plants will announced in the next few years," Demel said in an interview with Reuters. He said Brazil, where parent company Volkswagen has extensive operations, and India were "interesting candidates" but said there would be no new plant in the United States before 2000. "We are thinking about several potential sites, but we could imagine building where VW is currently located," he said. "We want to do everything to build as many Audis in Germany as possible and also build as many vehicles in foreign countries as needed," he said. "One must build cars as close to the market as possible. You cannot supply markets in South America or Asia only from Ingolstadt." Brazil is widely rumoured to be the top site for a plant to build the new compact A3 sedan, modelled on the platform of the VW Golf. Top Audi officials have said potential A3 production in Brazil could reach about 25,000 to 30,000 vehicles per year. Audi is eyeing the South American market as a lucrative region to sell the three-door vehicle, which fills a void at the lower price range of the carmaker's premium product line. The European launch of the A3 is set for early September. Demel declined to predict potential investment in new plants, which would likely assemble car pieces from other countries, but said it would likely be self-financed. The foreign expansion is also aimed at reducing Audi's exposure to the strong mark, which burdened 1995 profits by about 300 million marks ($203 million). Demel said he did not expect any burden on its 1996 results from currency market volatility.
