Indonesian palm olein prices eased further in late trade on Thursday ahead of possible government intervention. Traders said ready palm olein was quoted at between 1,520 rupiah/kg and 1,530 rupiah/kg in Jakarta and Surabaya, or lower than the morning price of 1,550 rupiah/kg. They said olein in Medan remained at 1,480 rupiah/kg. "It seems that traders have started to offer lower prices. News of possible government intervention has cause some nervousness in the market," one trader said. They said they had not heard any fresh tender of crude palm oil, which was last sold at 1,247.5 rupiah/kg on Tuesday. Traders earlier said buyers were seen holding back from any purchase, waiting for any price easing after the government was rumoured to have purchased some cooking oil in Malaysia and also some weakening in offshore markets. Indonesia's state logistics agency BULOG said on the weekend it planned to intervene in the market to push palm olein prices down in an effort to stabilse cooking oil prices. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
