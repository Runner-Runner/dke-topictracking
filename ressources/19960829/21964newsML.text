Swiss shares slid into negative terrain towards the end of the session to finish lower after strong U.S. economic data awakened interest rate fears. Market attention focused on Roche, Ciba and Sandoz and on insurer Swiss Re. The pharmaceuticals were still battered as market disappointment with the companies' half-year figures persisted, a dealer said. Swiss Re ended a streak of solid gains following Tuesday's announcement it would acquire Mercantile & General Re to end below Wednesday's close. The shares lost nine francs to 1,307. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) at 3,682.6 points, down 10.0 points, or 0.27 percent, from Wednesday's close and the all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) lost 5.26 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,361.03 points. There were two currents in the market, dealers said. While industrials were mostly lower, financials generally firmed. Ciba and Sandoz, which plan to merge to Novartis, fell around 0.5 percent each. Roche certificages ended down 40 francs at 9,230. UBS bounced back after Wednesday's losses, ending up five francs to 1,180. Insurers Zurich and Winterthur were firmer. Second-tier Georg Fischer slumped 2.6 percent to 1,210 francs after the company said this morning its first half group profit net fell to 20 million francs from 35 million a year earlier. One dealer said the results were reflective of the troubles experienced by the Swiss machine industry. The machine industry on Wednesday said orders fell 7.1 percent year-on-year in the first six months of 1996. Immuno advanced three francs to 886. U.S. company Baxter said it would bid for Immuno, offering 900 francs for public shareholders. Shares of watchmaker SMH bucked the trend and soared around 1.5 percent. Shares of Jungfraubahn Holding AG, which were traded for the first time today, ended at 221,75 after an initial price of 220 francs and an intra-day high of 225 francs.
