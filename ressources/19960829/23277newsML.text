Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd and associate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd have agreed to pay a land premium of HK$3.4 billion for a reclamation site in Hung Hom, the Hong Kong Economic Journal said on Thursday. The premium was reduced from the original HK$4.4 billion, the Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted unidentified property sources as saying. A company, equally owned by Cheung Kong and Hutchison, entered into a joint venture agreement with the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corp (KCRC) last December for the joint develoment of a commercial complex on the site. Cheung Kong and Hutchison are understood to be paying the land premium. Officials of the companies were not available for comment and a government official involved in the deal declined to comment. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6590
