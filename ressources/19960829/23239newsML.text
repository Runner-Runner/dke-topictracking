Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd took a lead in a sales race for the digital video disc (DVD) market on Thursday by announcing its launch of players using next-generation recording technology on November 1. Japan's electrical and electronics giant announced on Thursday that it would launch two types of DVD players in Japan on November 1 costing 79,800 yen ($738) and 98,000 yen ($907). It said it aims to produce 30,000 players a month. Matsushita is the first company in the world to unveil details of its line-up and other Japanese makers are also planning to sell DVD players. DVD is a new recording system which has large storage capacity and is expected to eventually make videocassette recorders, compact disc (CD) players and CD-ROMs obsolete. The DVD system uses new laser technology to store up to 4.7 gigabytes of data on each side of a disc, enough to record 133 minutes of film and sound. Toshiba Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Pioneer Electronic Corp are planning to launch their DVD players later this year. Sony Corp said it was planning to start selling DVD players and software next spring. A Toshiba spokeswoman said earlier this week that the company was planning to start selling DVD players in Japan and the United States simultaneously in October or in November. The price of the player will be less than 100,000 yen ($925) in Japan and between $600 and $800 in the United States, she said. Hitachi said it was planning to start selling its DVD players in Japan in late October and abroad in December. It did not provide details of its players. Pioneer said it would begin sales of its DVD players in late October but it did not elaborate. A Sony spokesman said it would begin selling DVD players in the United States, Japan and the other parts of Asia in the spring of next year. Sales in Europe would begin in mid-1997, he said.
