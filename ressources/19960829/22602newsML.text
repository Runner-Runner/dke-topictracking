NEW YORK, August 29 (LPC) - BankAmerica Corp and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette have underwritten a loan of about $200 million to fund Thomas H. Lee's leveraged recapitalization of Rayovac Corp, banking sources said. The leveraged buyout firm plans to acquire 80 percent of Rayovac equity, sources added. Sources said the credit will have several tranches, with probably opening pricing of 250 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Syndication should begin within the next few weeks, bankers said. The bank deal is one of the first syndicated loans led by DLJ, bankers said. DLJ has for the past several months been hiring high-profile syndicators from established banks and investment banks, they said. --Beth Harmen, LPC Editorial, 212 489-5455
