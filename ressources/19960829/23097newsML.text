Insurance group MMI Ltd said on Thursday that it was on track to report stronger earnings in the year to June 30, 1997. "MMI is well positioned for 1997. When we announced our strategic plan we stated that 1995/96 would be a relatively flat year and that profit would flow through in 1997, and we are on track towards achieving this result," MMI managing director, Pieter Franzen said in a statement.   MMI earlier said its net profit for the year to June 30, 1996 rose six percent to A$35.1 million. Franzen said the year ahead would be challenging because rates were softening under the pressure of excess capital and competition. However, he said the benefits from MMI's corporate change program should offset this. To position itself for further growth MMI said it had invested A$8 million of a planned A$14 million in process re-engineering, streamling of operations and product development. The balance would be invested in 1996/97.   MMI is about 48 percent owned by the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800
