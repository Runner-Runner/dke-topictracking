Mineral sands and base metals miner RGC Ltd said on Thursday it expects tin to trade around the US$6,000 to $6,500 per tonne market over the next year. "We think it will move around US$6,000 to $6,500 probably, it may expand to $7,000, but $6,000 to $6,500 is a good price for tin," RGC managing director Mark Bethwaite told reporters after the miner reported its 1995/96 annual results. Bethwaite said RGC had about 15 percent of the world tin market. RGC, which is about 40 percent owned by British conglomerate Hanson Plc, produced around 16,000 tonnes of tin in concentrate in the latest year.   RGC earlier reported a doubling of operating profit to A$108.57 million in the year to June 30, 1996. At 3.50 p.m. (0550 GMT), RGC shares were two cents up at A$5.95. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
