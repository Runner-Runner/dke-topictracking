RGC Ltd said it has made no decision on re-opening the closed mineral sands mine in Sierra Leone operated by Sierra Rutile Co, which is 50 percent owned by RGC-controlled Consolidated Rutile Ltd. "Obviously there is a bit of an interest in Sierra Rutile, but I am have not been there yet, so there is no decision on the situation so far," RGC managing director Mark Bethwaite told reporters on Thursday. The Sierra Rutile mine, which is jointly owned by Nord Resources Corp, was closed in January 1995 after it was over-run by rebels.   RGC has a 76.7 percent stake in Cudgen RZ Ltd following its takeover offer for the Queensland-based group, which in turn owns 50.1 percent of Consolidated Rutile. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
