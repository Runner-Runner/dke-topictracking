Property investment and development group Hopewell Holdings Ltd said on Thursday the company had dropped its plan to seek a listing for its transport unit Consolidated Real Estate and Transport Asia Ltd (CREATA). "The directors have decided not to proceed with the proposed reorganisation of Hopewell's transport projects under CREATA and the intended listing of CREATA," it said in a statement. This confirmed press reports earlier that the plan was abandoned. Hopewell said it was in negotiation for alternative funding plans and shareholders would be informed when a decision was made which was expected to be in the near future.   The company earlier said it was considering placing stakes in its Thai rail system unit, which would seek a separate listing at the end of 1996 or early 1997, to finance the project. But Hong Kong analysts were worried that Hopewell might find difficulties in funding its infrastructure developments, mainly toll roads, in China. Hopewell shares closed five cents lower at HK$4.35 on Wednesday. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6369
