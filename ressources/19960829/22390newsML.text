Corporate Express Inc said it expected lower earnings from its Australian unit through the end of the fiscal year because of consolidations. The company said in a statement on Thursday that Corporate Express Australia expected sales for the first six months ending Aug 31, 1996 to exceed US$100 million. The company said its 52-percent-owned subsidiary had experienced rapid revenue increases based on both internal growth and 15 acquisitions. The company, a supplier of office products and services to corporations, said it would "accelerate the process of merging and consolidating these businesses into a single regional distribution center in each major market in order to minimize operating costs and increase its leadership position." Three warehouses have already been consolidated and closed, six are in progress and five more will commence in the near future. "The company anticipates that consolidation expenses will lower earnings in Australia until the end of the fiscal year, when the consolidations are expected to be substantially completed," the statement said. -- New York newsroom, (212) 859-1610
