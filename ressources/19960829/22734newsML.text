Labour and Social Affairs Minister Jacques Barrot said in an interview to appear on Saturday that government economic policy concerned crucial choices for the future and could not be compromised for consensus at any cost. "It's not now that France is making choices for the future that we should give in to discouragement, doubt, and, for some, a protest that can only be sterile," he said in an interview to be published in Valeurs Actuelles. He told the magazine he did not favour "consensus at any price." An advance copy of the interview was supplied to Reuters. Fears of an autumn of industrial unrest in France drove down French stocks and put pressure on the franc, which fell to a five-month low against the mark at one stage. Prime Minister Alain Juppe's cabinet reconvened on Wednesday after the summer break and has started on the offensive, with President Jacques Chirac, Juppe and other ministers defending their policies and calling for less gloom among the population. Referring to reports quoting France's national health insurance fund chairman Jean-Marie Spaeth as saying he expected a social security deficit this year of 50 to 55 billion francs, Barrot said social security reforms would not be in place until 1997. He said this year's goal was to contain spending. Barrot said an economic recovery would rely heavily on the services sector and added that it was essential to reduce labour costs and increase flexibility. -- Paris Newsroom, +33 1 4221 5452
