Pakistan's Askari Commercial Bank rose 0.35 rupees, or 1.67 percent, to 21.25 on Thursday on hopes of good half-year results, dealers said. Some 7,000 shares of the bank changed hands at the Karachi bourse in early trade. Dealer Ambreen Shoukat said the stock had earlier been under pressure on rumours that its profits had fallen. "But it firmed again on reports of good profits," she said. Askari Bank is expected to announce its six-month results in the next few days. Its financial year ends in December. "It is among the top five banks and has good prospects," dealer Rony Byramjee said. -- Karachi newsroom 9221-5685192
