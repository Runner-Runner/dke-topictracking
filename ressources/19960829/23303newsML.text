Malaysia's Repco Holdings Bhd has conditionally agreed to acquire the entire equity interest in a sawmill holding company for 25 million ringgit, the national Bernama news agency said on Thursday. It quoted a Repco statement as saying that the vendors of Yap Yee Sine Holdings Sdn Bhd (YYS) have guaranteed a pre-tax profit of no less than 1.5 million ringgit from July 31, 1996 to the date when the acquisition is completed. YYS is an investment holding company with sawmill operations involving subsidiaries Pitas Timber Complex Sdn Bhd and Gold Rank Sdn Bhd. Pitas and Gold Rank operate adjoining sawmills in Tawau in eastern Sabah state. Timber and gaming firm Repco said the proposed acquisition is aimed at expanding and diversifying the scope of its timber operations. Pitas' facility is close to the waterway along which logs from the Sapulut forest reserve are expected to be transported on.   Repco is expected to be given the exclusive right to extract and buy timber from an area measuring 24,300 hectares in the Sapulut reserve following its earlier proposals to acquire two other companies. Repco will pay for the planned acquisition by issuing 400,000 new shares at 62.50 ringgit each to YYS, while a cash deposit of one million ringgit will be paid within a week of the signing of the agreement. Shares of Repco have been suspended since August 15 pending a news announcement. They were last traded at 62.50 ringgit.
