Bangladesh should shed more than 46,000 government jobs, abolish nearly 50 redundant agencies and merge several ministries to make the administration more efficient and transparent. The measures were recommended on Thursday by an Administrative Reorganisation Committee, headed by retired bureaucrat Nurunnabi Chowdhury, who told a news conference he had submitted the proposals to the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. He said they would save the treasury $40 million annually. Whether the recommendations would be implemented -- in full or part -- had not been decided, government officials said. The committee recommended a cut in government jobs of 46,276 to 553,154. Wages and benefits for government employees take up a large share of the country's budget, and are often criticised by aid donors. The committee suggested that the number of ministries be streamlined to 22 from 35 and that nearly 50 government agencies be abolished. It specifically recommended the merger of the ministries of jute, textile, commerce and industry. Chowdhury said abolition of the agencies and reducing the number of ministries would "limit frequent overlapping...and ease procedural tangles." He said the measures would inject more efficiency and transparency into the government. Many offices and ministries had become redundant as Bangladesh developed a free market economy, he added.
