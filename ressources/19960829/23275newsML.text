The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it is considering subsidising Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd's project to develop a small passenger plane with Bombardier Inc of Canada. It is also considering subsidies for a project in which Mitsubishi and four other Japanese aircraft makers expect to help develop the next generation of Boeing Co's 747-400 model. "We are considering subsidising the two projects and whether or not we will actually do so will be clear in early September," a ministry official said. A Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman said on Thursday that Mitsubishi was conducting a feasibility study with Bombardier on a joint development of 100-seat passenger planes. The Japanese daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Thursday that Bombardier had told the newspaper that Boeing would participate in the project. The Mitsubishi spokesman said the company did not know of Boeing's participation. Separately, Mitsubishi and four other Japanese aircraft makers expect to join with Boeing to develop the next generation of Boeing's popular 747-400 jumbo jet, the aircraft makers said.   The other four makers are Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Japan Aircraft Manufacturing Co Ltd and ShinMaywa Industries Ltd. The Japanese aircraft makers did not provide details of the next generation plane. But the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that Boeing was planning to develop two new models of the 747 family and the total development cost would be $2 billion to $5 billion. One of the new models would carry about 550 passengers, up 140 from the current 747-400 jumbo jet, becoming the largest passenger plane, the newspaper said. The paper said the Japanese firms would account for 15 to 20 percent of the development and production of the new plane.
