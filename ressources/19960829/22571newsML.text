Privatisation of certain state assets in Saudi Arabia could raise about 100 billion riyals ($26.7 billion), a Saudi newspaper quoted an academic as saying on Thursday. The daily Saudi Gazette quoted Dr Salem al-Ghamdi as saying the privatisation process would take some time and "possibly in three to eight years' time the process may be completed". Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is actively reviewing privatisation options to reduce the state's dominant role in the economy and raise revenues after more than a decade of big budget deficits. Al-Ghamdi is a professor at the management and marketing department at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. He said privatisation could include the sale of government holdings in telephones, railways, electricity and education services, the national carrier Saudi Arabian Airlines Corp and in some 37 firms on the Saudi stock market. On Monday King Fahd said the government would encourage the private sector in order to boost economic development. "The government gives great importance to the private sector and will continue to support it," he told the weekly cabinet meeting. ($1 = 3.75 riyals)
