Japanese aircraft makers will join with Boeing Co to develop the next generation of its popular 747-400 jumbo jet, a Japanese newspaper said on Thursday. The Japanese makers include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, the business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said. Company spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. The paper said the Japanese firms would account for 15 to 20 percent of the development and production of the new plane.
