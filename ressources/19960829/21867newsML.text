Ford Motor Co expects sales for its 1997 Expedition sport utility vehicle to quadruple those of its current full-size offering, the Ford Bronco, according to Expedition Brand Manager Bob Girard. Ford is discontinuing its Bronco line this year, Girard said. It will produce about 140,000 Expeditions for 1997. Speaking at a debut for the much-anticipated Ford Expedition in New York, Girard said the company expects "some" cannibalization of the market for its highly successful compact sport utility vehicle, the Explorer.
