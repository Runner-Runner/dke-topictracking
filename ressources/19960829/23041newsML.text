Recent frost in Queensland may reduce the state's 1996/97 wheat crop by about five percent, a spokesman for the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said. AWB field staff were now assessing the extent of the damage, he said. "It will be taken into account in our (next) assessment of the size of the national crop," AWB spokesman Alex Nichol said. Further figures were not expected for a couple of days at least, he said. "Our early feeling is that it may have reduced the crop by about 100,000 tonnes," he said.   The AWB's forecast for the Queensland crop, before the frost, was 1.8 million tonnes. The AWB's next crop forecast will be released on Monday. Frost effects in Queensland may be masked by developments elsewhere around Australia with the 1996/97 crop, he said. The full extent of frost damage on affected tonnages is not expected to be known until possibly close to harvest. Frost has the potential to either entirely wipe out grain or to more mildly affect yields.   The AWB's official forecast is for a 17.6 million tonne Australia-wide wheat crop for 1996/97, although private forecasters have been saying for many weeks that the crop is more likely to be about 20 million tonnes. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
