German carmaker Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen AG, said on Thursday that it expected actual production of its popular A4 saloon and estate cars to peak in 1996. Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel said in an interview that he expected the production of about 270,000 A4 vehicles in 1995 to be topped in 1996 but declined to be specific. Demel downplayed concerns about the A3 taking away sales of the A4 or the popular VW Golf, saying the substitution rate against the A4 would be about 20 to 25 percent. "There is always going to be some overlap when one introduces a new model," Demel said. Demel said he did not expect the same sort of dramatic growth spurt in sales seen after the A4 introduction. "We will certainly not see the same sort of growth spurt that we saw from the A4 but the A3 will certainly lead to more growth for us," Demel said. "The positioning of the Audi brand name in the market is more important than volume growth," he said. "We want the A3 to play the role of drawing in younger and more dynamic buyers into the Audi premium product line." But company officials have said they expect the A3 to account for about 20 percent of total production by 1998. Audi plans to build about 100,000 of the A3 vehicles this year. Demel also dismissed speculation Audi was planning a vehicle smaller than the A3. "You can read a lot that we are planning a smaller vehicle but you will not see that from us. The A3 for now is going to be the smallest car that we are going to build," he said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
