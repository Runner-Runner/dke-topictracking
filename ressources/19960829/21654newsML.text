An Israeli soldier was killed and others were wounded on Thursday when Moslem guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol close to the border in south Lebanon, pro-Israeli militia sources said. The ambush took place near an Israeli strongpoint at Blat, one km (half a mile) north of the Israeli border, and guerrillas shelled the position after the attack, the sources with the South Lebanon Army (SLA) said. The number of wounded soldiers was not immediately known. In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying its guerrillas ambushed the patrol with machineguns and rockets at a point about 700 metres (yards) from the border. The dead soldier brought to 19 the number of Israelis killed in south Lebanon this year. He was the third killed this month. One soldier was killed and two were wounded on August 6 in a guerrilla attack on their position. Another soldier was killed in south Lebanon on August 20 by friendly fire. The SLA sources said guerrillas continued shelling the Blat strongpoint for more than an hour after the ambush, and Israeli artillery hit back at suspected guerrilla positions. A Hizbollah spokesman said the attack took place at 5.15 p.m. (1405 GMT) and fighting continued on the ground for more than an hour. Hizbollah also shelled the Israeli strongpoint, he said.
