Pulp prices are likely to rise slightly this autumn, but the break-even level will probably not be reached this year, Finnish Forest Industries Federation chairman Jukka Harmala said on Thursday. "Currently, pulp is trading at a level of $560/tonne and in autumn we can expect a slightly stronger price," Harmala said in the text of a prepared spech. "We are unlikely to reach this year ... the price of $650 per tonne regarded in the Nordic countries as the limit for profitable production," he added.   "Wood-based LWC-, SC- and newsprint paper prices have fallen recently and further downward pressures remain," Harmala said. But thanks to the price rise in pulp, "a rising trend can be seen for fine paper prices", he said. Although the rock-bottom price level for pulp and fine paper was past, prices were still far from last year's peaks, he said. Measured by annual averages, sawn goods prices were likely to be about 10 percent lower this year than in 1995, and up to 25 percent below peak levels at the end of 1995, he said. The Finnish forest industry's 1996 production volume would be "many percent" below last year's, Harmala said. "This means that the forest industry's (total) profit will halve compared to last year and will be at best satisfactory," he added. It was still too early to say anything certain about next year. "Economic growth in Europe is just budding. Optimism is based more on visions than on facts," Harmala said. --Helsinki Newsroom  +358 - 0 - 680 50 245
