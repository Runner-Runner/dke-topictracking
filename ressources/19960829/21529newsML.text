Economists generally expect bond yields to retrace their steps slightly by year-end, but primarily on the back of a weakening U.S. Treasury market, which is seen facing tighter monetary policy amid a rebounding economy. However, Australia's positive outlook on inflation, international confidence in the the country post-budget and S&P's revised outlook, and the prospect of a further cut in official interest rates should see the local market's outperformance against the U.S. continue and see the yield spread compress further. The 10-year bond yield touched its lowest level since March 1994 on Wednesday at just below 7.80 percent following the budget and S&P's report, while the spread currently stands at around 125 basis points, its lowest level in over two years and half the level seen last April. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar will be underpinned by a global economic rebound, stronger commodity prices and through demand for Australian debt for the reasons above. However, the possibility of another rate cut and a further erosion of the yield diffential, particularly if the U.S. does tighten, could weigh on the currency. The AUD was trading just over US$79 cents on Friday.

The trend should remain flat to slightly negative and analysts see little prospect of a pickup until mortgage commitments show some sustained growth and the overhang of surplus property declines. RETAIL TRADE Retail trade was seen recording a small gain in July in line with a flattening trend in recent months and only modest employment growth. Cuts in mortgage interest rates that month might have helped sentiment but borrowers' bills would not have reflected the easing for a month or so. Consumers might also have been intimidated by growing negative press speculation ahead of the August budget. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
