Metropolitan Entertainment Group said on Thursday it formed a record label to complement its activities in production, artist management and concert promotion. The label, hybrid Recordings, will focus on the development of new artists and the production of live event-driven projects, film soundtracks and Broadway cast albums, a statement said. It will also release home videos.   Metropolitan Entertainment is a recently created 50/50 joint-venture between global service company Ogden Corp and veteran promoter John Scher. Hybrid's first release will be Art Garfunkel's "Across America", a live audio and visual documentation of the singer's concert this past April on Ellis Island, the first public performance on the historic landmark. It is scheduled for a late-October release. Additionally, hybrid plans to issue a compilation of previously unreleased tracks recorded during the summer's Further Festival tour, which featured such artists as Los Lobos, Bruce Hornsby, Bob Weir's "RatDog" and Mickey Hart's "Mystery Box". No release date has been set yet. A distributor for the recordings will be announced shortly, a statement said. The label will be headed by Scher and Michael Leon, senior vice-president of Metropolitan Entertainment's music division. Foye Johnson, formerly of Private Music and Imago Records, will oversee marketing as well as artists and repertoire (A & R); Eric Levine, formerly of Island Records and Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, will handle business and legal affairs, the statement said.
