German luxury carmaker Audi AG said on Thursday that group pre-tax profit rose 58 percent to 405 million marks ($274.5 million) as foreign sales expanded amid a downturn in the German market. The carmaker, a unit of Volkswagen AG, said worldwide sales rose to 9.3 billion marks from 8.2 billion marks in the year-ago period. Despite the higher sales and profits, Audi said its group cash flow fell to 759 million marks from 778 million marks in the 1995 period. But the carmaker said investments were up 33 percent to 483 million marks. Audi said 246,597 vehicles were delivered to customers in 105 countries, up from 231,884 in the first six months of 1995. Global vehicle production at Audi's plants in six countries rose to 238,105 units from 219,758. Audi said the percentage of vehicle sales outside of Germany rose to 55 percent during the six-month period from 51 percent in the 1995 period, but said German sales to customers fell 2.1 percent to 110,262 vehicles. The carmaker, whose sales have been fuelled by its award-winning A4 saloon and estate vehicles, said its share of the German car market in the first half of the year fell to 5.8 percent from 6.4 percent. European sales outside of Germany rose 14 percent to 97,389 vehicles and strong sales gains were reported in Britain, Spain and Austria. The U.S. market, where Audi has been seeking to rebuild its presence after a disastrous fall in the region's sales during late 1980s and early 1990s, rose 46 percent to 12,702 vehicles during the period compared to the first six months of 1995. In Japan, Audi said it increased first-half sales to 5,124 vehicles from 3,697 in the year-earlier period. ($ = 1.475 German Marks)
