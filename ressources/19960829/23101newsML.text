Reserve Bank of New Zealand Deputy Governor Murray Sherwin said on Thursday the bank was not opposed in principle to signing repurchase agreements with other countries, but its foreign exchange reserves were limited. Sherwin was speaking before a meeting with Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, who told reporters the colony was looking to extend its range of repo agreements. Sherwin said he had discussed the possibility of such arrangements last year with other Asian central banks.   "Our basic attitude has been...since we don't intervene in foreign exchange markets and we have a very small and very liquid portfolio anyway, there's nothing in it from our side," he told Reuters. "But we're not in principle opposed to signing up one of these things if someone felt that it was important to them." New Zealand has total reserves equivalent to some US$2.7 billion, of which just over $1 billion is in U.S. dollars.   A repurchase agreement enables a country with liquidity pressures to deposit U.S. government securities to the credit of another country at the U.S. Federal Reserve, receiving liquid U.S. dollars in exchange. The transaction is later unwound after an agreed period. Tsang told a news conference earlier: "Hong Kong is rather keen to enter into repurchase agreements with a number of central banks. That came home after the Mexican peso crisis early last year."   Since then, he said Hong Kong had entered six or seven repurchase arrangements with neighbouring countries, "and we can extend and talk to more". -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 471-4277
