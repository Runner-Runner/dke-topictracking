Japan's economy is still on a gradual recovery track despite weak business sentiment shown in the Bank of Japan's "tankan" economic survey released on Wednesday, Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa told a news conference on Thursday.   "Looking at the overall data, there is no change in our view that the economy is continuing its gradual recovery," he said. Asked about the need to draw up a supplementary budget for this fiscal year to boost the economy, Ogawa reiterated that the ministry is not considering such an option at the moment. The economy is still on a recovery track, although the tempo is slower than in past recovery phases, he said. He said it was important to steadily implement the original budget for this fiscal year and that the ministry also had to take into account tight state finances.   The tankan survey for August showed that the business outlook among major manufacturers had worsened since the previous survey in May, with the August diffusion index for major manufacturers at minus 7. Ogawa did not think there would be any large fall-off in public works spending later this year as there were still projects to be carried over from last year's 14 trillion yen stimulus package. "I expect about the same size of public works projects to be implemented as previously in the second half of the fiscal year. I don't expect to see an especially big difference."
