British supermarket chain J. Sainsbury Plc is seeing a 2-3 percent uplift in sales following the launch of its Reward loyalty card in June, deputy chief executive Dino Adriano told Reuters in an interview. "We said when we launched it that we needed an uplift of something like 2-3 percent to cover its costs and that's what it's doing," Adriano said.
