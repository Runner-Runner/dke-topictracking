Heavy marketing expenses incurred in a mobile phone sales war and escalating materials costs pushed Danish telecoms giant Tele Danmark's first half 1996 result down by 20 percent from the same period last year. Tele Danmark on Thursday reported pre-tax profit of 2.178 billion crowns compared to 2.721 billion in the first half of 1995 and said that marketing costs totalled a hefty 524 million crowns out of total operating expenses of 8.288 billion crowns, up from 6.430 billion during the same period last year.
