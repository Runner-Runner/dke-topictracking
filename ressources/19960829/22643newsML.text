Hurricanes Edouard and Fran marched across the Atlantic on Thursday, prompting U.S. forecasters to issue a hurricane watch for the northern Leeward Islands. The most powerful of the storms, Hurricane Edouard, was expected to turn north and avoid the southern U.S. coastline, forecasters from the National Hurricane Center said. Edouard, packing maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (200 kmh), might still pose a threat to the mid-Atlantic coast, they said. "We still have to keep our eye on Edouard but we're expecting a turn in its course today," said forecaster Bill Fredericks. At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Edouard was located 940 miles (1,500 km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, or at latitude 23.6 north and longitude 67.6 west. It was moving west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kmh). Forecasters were also concerned about Hurricane Fran, which reached minimal hurricane-strength winds overnight. Hurricane watches were posted for several Leeward Islands, including Antigua, Barbuda and St. Martin. At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Fran was located 385 miles east (620 km) of Antigua, at latitude 17.2 north and longitude 55.8 west, and moving west-northwest at 15 mph (25 kmh). "We're expecting Fran to strengthen, and we'll be sending a reconnaissance plane into the storm later today," Fredericks said. Fran had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kmh), and could threaten the Caribbean islands late on Friday or on Saturday, he said. Tropical Storm Gustav was lined up behind Fran, at latitude 13.4 north and longitude 36.7 west. The storm had maximum winds of 40 mph (65 kmh) and was on a northwesterly course which was expected to keep the storm safely out at sea. "It's the busiest time of the year for hurricanes," Fredericks said. "The peak of the season is always around the Labor Day holiday."
