A new Spanish domestic carrier, Canarias Regional Air is due to start scheduled services on November 1, company president Juan Socastro told Reuters. The company will operate from regional hubs in the Balearics, Canaries and mainland Spain, he said in an interview. It will use eight 65-seat, British Aerospace Advanced Turboprop (ATP) aircraft due for delivery between November 1996 and May 1997, he added. The ATPs will be leased from British Aerospace's Asset Management Turboprop on terms described by Socastro as "very attractive" and which include provision of some free spare parts and maintenance support. The first aircraft will be used to operate scheduled services from Palma de Majorca (Balearics) to Ibiza, Mahon, Malaga, Alicante and Valencia from November 1, he said. The next three to operate services from Madrid to Saragossa, Granada and Vigo from December 1 and the remainder on services within the Canaries in 1997. Canarias Regional Air will be based Tenerife and 50 percent owned by Air Europa, Spain's largest independent airline, with remaining equity held by private travel companies, he added. "The new airline," said Socastro, "will be launched with a capitalisation of 390 million pesetas provided by shareholders and will have no bank borrowings." Air Europe operates scheduled/charter services from Spain throughout Europe with a fleet of 25 Boeing jets and will provide operational support to the new airline in exchange for guarantees that it does not compete outside Spain. Socastro said Canarias is targeting a market of five million people and will offer fares averaging 25 percent below those of domestic rivals Iberia and Binter. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
