The government on Thursday issued a regulation for a futures exchange in the main cotton producing region in western Turkey where cotton will initially be traded, the Official Gazette said. The regulation, which took immediate effect, defines the operation and duties of the exchange administration, the method how the traders and brokers will carry out transactions, and custody and settlement procedures. But it did not say when the exchange would be opened. The exchange's opening has been delayed due to a rift over control between Turkey's securities watchdog, Capital Markets Board (SPK), and Izmir Trade Bourse (ITB), which masterminded the exchage in early 1990s. The industry ministry, which regulates cotton production and its domestic and foreign trade, sided with the ITB in the dispute. Industry Minister Yalim Erez earlier said the exchange would be opened despite opposition from the SPK, which says futures contracts to be used on the exchange are a type of security that should be controlled by the board. No official was available for comment on whether the dispute was resolved or when the exchange will actually begin trading. --Ercan Ersoy, Ankara Newsroom, 90-312-4462940
