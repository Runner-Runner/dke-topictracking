The Indonesian rupiah firmed against the dollar in slow late trading on Thursday, with some easing seen in the six-month swap rate, dealers said. They said the rupiah firmed up against the dollar after a peaceful end to a court hearing on Thursday involving Megawati Sukarnoputri, former leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), who has sued the government for backing her ouster. Central Jakarta State Court adjourned the case to September 5 after the parties did not reach an out-of-court settlement. Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,342.0/43.0 at 0925 GMT compared with an opening of 2,343.0/44.0.   Dealers said the firming was anticipated but operators were cautious due to the month-end factor on Friday. They said there was not much room for further appreciation of the rupiah due to the central bank's ceiling. One European bank dealer said one U.S. insurance company was seen offloading six-month swaps through the Singapore market because of limited lines available in Jakarta. Six-month swap edged down to 103.00/103.75 from 104.25. He said some operators seemed to be trying to establish short dollars positions by selling forwards and swaps.   One local bank dealer said it might indicate increased confidence in the rupiah market although the law suit had not been settled yet. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,340.40/40.70 and 2,340.60/41.00, respectively. Overnight swap was at 0.45/0.50 and tom/next at 2.15/2.25. Overnight money was traded last at 10.0 percent. One-month swap was at 16.50/16.80, two at 34.0/35.5 and three at 51.5/52.5 points. The central bank kept its intervention rate at 2,339/2,457 and the conversion rate at 2,339/2,385 on Thursday. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
