German call money traded steady below three percent on Thursday as the market continued to steer towards a calm end to the month, dealers said. Overnight funds were trading between 2.90/2.95 percent on Thursday, mostly unchanged from Wednesday's levels as liquidity conditions remained ample. Dealers said banks had had an excess of funds this morning with some banks having some trouble placing the funds today. Although very recent reserve figures were not available, dealers also said most banks seemed to have met their monthly reserve requirements, paving the way for a smooth month-end.   On Tuesday reserve holdings at the Bundesbank stood at 40.4 billion marks compared with 39.2 billion marks on Monday. The monthly average was at 38.6 billion marks compared with 38.5 billion marks. Lombard borrowings on Wednesday were at 100 million marks. The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average was set at 2.98792 percent on Thursday compared with 3.02667 percent. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
