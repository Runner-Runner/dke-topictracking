Johnny Akerholm, a key Finnish finance ministry official and member of the EU's monetary committee, attended a meeting at the ministry on Thursday, ministry officials said. He was not due to travel abroad on Friday or over the weekend, they added. Akerholm and Bank of Finland board member Matti Vanhala are Finland's two members of the committee and their movements are watched closely by forex market players in anticipation of a possible decision by Finland to link the markka to Europe's exchange rate mechanism ERM. The Bank of Finland said it would not comment, either on Thursday or in future, on the whereabouts of its board members or other key decision-makers. "Our policy is to not reveal the whereabouts of our board members or other decision-makers," central bank chief spokesman Antti Juusela told Reuters. "The policy will be the same in the future, too," he said. On Thursday, Finnish forex dealers said the market was rife with rumours Vanhala was abroad, which some operators said might indicate that a decision on a markka link to ERM was imminent. --Helsinki Newsroom  +358 - 0 - 680 50 245
