A dip in London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminium prices has sparked interest in forward buying on Europe's physical market, traders said on Thursday. Many premiums have popped up slightly from last month, but most traders see them slipping towards the end of the year. "At the moment the only interest is the lower LME which is attracting people to buy on a forward basis but the real physical need is not there. There are too many stocks around," said a trader in Europe. Three month LME prices have slipped from a recent peak of $1,540 per tonne on July 30 to a low of $1,470 on Monday. Another European trader said forward buying was expected to centre on early 1997 dates. "There is no reasonable demand for the nearby and I think it can improve until the end of the year but there will be nothing spectacular. What we should see is better demand for the forward and mainly 1997," he said. "We should see more significant buying for first quarter than for anything else...I don't think people will rush to buy third or fourth quarter because nobody knows what the market will do next year," he added. There was less availability of some Russian material, but this situation was not expected to last, traders said. "It is not exactly tight, but there is not so much around," one said. One trader said it was more difficult to find A5 and A6 but another cited A5 and A0 as the varieties in short supply. Premiums for A0 had recently firmed to a $25 discount from $40/45 last month, but they were now around $30/35. Some customers were finding the A6 attractive, one European trader said. "People can use the A6 for their own applications or just mixing a little bit with something else so they prefer to buy A6 at flat rather than pay a premium of $15/20 (for A7E)," he said. Demand was stronger in Europe than in the U.S. and the Far East, which was expected to attract CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) metal to Europe, a London trader said. "The CIS metal will change its destination to the European area because the premium is quite good, so we will see much more supply towards the end of this year," he said. The trader believed this would pressure premiums over coming months and others agreed that premiums did not have much more room to firm. "I believe there is enough metal around. I don't see it higher, I even think it is high now," one said.
