The 910 megawatt (MW) Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset, Maine, shut since July 20 to upgrade the plant's cooling water system, began restart Thursday, the company said in a statement. Although the cooling system repairs were completed in mid-August, the outage continued following a failed test of an electrical circuit due to a cut wire.   During the outage, electrical cables inside containment were also upgraded. The statement said it should take several days to return the plant to service due to required system testing. The plant is owned by a consortium of New England electric utilities. The majority owners include Central Maine Power with 38 percent, New England Electric System with 20 percent, and Northeast Utilities with 20 percent. --New York Power Desk 212-859-1639
