Shares on the Lima stock exchange closed up on Thursday as this week's investor optimism continued, brokers said. While the stock exchange will be closed on Friday due to a national holiday, the upward trend was expected to continue next week, brokers said. With investors generally bullish for the medium- and long- term prospects on the equities market, an upbeat visit to Peru by Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto earlier this week has been enough to give the exchange fresh impetus, they added.   Hashimoto signed on Tuesday loan agreements to Peru worth around $615 million for environmental, hydroelectric and road projects. He also said he would support the country's efforts to join the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group (APEC). Following two weeks of low volumes and dipping prices, the market has seen brisk trade and price rises each day this week. Thursday, the General Index, rose 0.11 percent to 1,428.6 points, while the blue-chip Selective Index rose 0.41 percent to 1,956.9 points, according to preliminary stock figures. Volume was 32.6 million soles ($13.3 million), where 42 stocks rose, 22 fell and 41 were stable.   "The buying trend continued due to the good news of the Japanese loan, which creates a good image of the country for the investors," said Carlos Reyes of the local brokerage Helvetia. Among leaders, telecom Tele 2000 saw its price rise 2.12 percent to 4.34 soles in volume of 37,000 shares. Edegel rose 1.22 percent to 5.79 soles in volume of 3.6 million soles. Despite the general trend, benchmark Telefonica del Peru edged down 0.69 percent to 5.77 soles on volume of 1.83 million shares. -- Paola Sandoval, Lima newsroom, 511 221-2134
