Croatia's Finance Ministry said on Thursday it would hold an auction for 80 million kuna worth of 45-day treasury bills on September 3. "(The procedure) will be similar to the last auction," Assistant Minister Hrvoje Radovanic told Reuters. The ministry first auctioned its short-term paper on July 24 when it planned to raise some 50 million kuna through 45-day T-bills. But the issue was overshot, totalling 58.8 million kuna, priced at 98.065 at an annual rate of 16 percent. The ministry said at the time the yield at future auctions would probably be lower, in line with declining interest rates paid by the National Bank of Croatia for its liquidity bills. The weighted five- and 13-week central bank bill rates fell to 7.98 and 9.25 percent respectively at Thursday's tender. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
