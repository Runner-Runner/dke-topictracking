**  (1030 GMT) Bombay shares retreat at close after strong rally on profit-taking **  Business mostly position adjustments in anticipation of tax reliefs to industry **  The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index ends nearly 55 points higher at provisional 3,493.24 after peaking at 3,528.19 **  Cement, steel, power shares lead upsurge --- Share prices ended higher on Thursday at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) after a strong rally triggered profit-taking towards the close, brokers said. The 30-share BSE index finished 54.44 points, or 1.58 percent, higher at a provisional 3,493.24 after rising to 3,529.19. Traders said the upsurge was pushed by reports that the government would ease a controversial minimum tax proposal for some sections of industry. "The market was largely speculator-driven," said one trader. "Short-sellers were busy squaring up positions."   Analysts said sentiment was also buoyed by good corporate results and bountiful rains across the country.
