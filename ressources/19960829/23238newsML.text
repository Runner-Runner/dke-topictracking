Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd said on Thursday that it would issue 56 million preferred shares worth 28 billion yen in September. It will be the first time that Hokkaido Takushoku has issued preferred stock.   Hokkaido Takushoku said in a statement the issue price of a preferred share was 500 yen and the payment date was September 18. The bank's share price closed down five yen at 280 yen. The preferred shares, which offer better dividends than common stock but do not give the holder a right to vote, is convertible into common stock between October 1, 1998 and September 30, 2001. If investors do not convert the preferred stock during that period, they will be forced to do so on October 1, 2001, it added. The preferred stock will be privately placed with a vehicle set up by third party investors, it said.   An official at Hokkaido Takushoku said the issue of preferred stock is expected to boost the bank's international capital adequacy ratio, under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements, to a level of between 9.2 percent and 9.5 percent from 8.68 percent as of the end of March 31, 1996.
