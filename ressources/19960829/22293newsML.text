Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co said on Thursday that, assuming moderate worldwide economic conditions, it expects more than 10 percent earnings gains in each of the next three years. "Several new-product development areas -- including highly efficient structured abrasives and materials that replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons -- make us confident that we can hit our growth targets," said L.D. DeSimone, 3M chairman of the board and chief executive officer.   "We're aggressively pursuing these opportunities through significant new capital investments. During 1996, we'll invest about $1 billion worldwide," he told security analysts in St. Paul. He said that 3M completed a comprehensive change with the spin-off of Imation Corp, which began operating as an independent company on July 1, 1996. DeSimone identified four areas considered crucial to the company's continued growth and profitability: new products, aggressive expansion into markets outside the United States, continuous productivity improvement and continuous operating improvements. 3M shares were up as much as 7/8 on Thursday afternoon but later slipped to 66-3/4, down 3/4, near the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. --Chicago newsdesk, 312 408-8787
