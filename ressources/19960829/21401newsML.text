Oxxo Express, a joint venture between Amoco Corp and Mexican bottler Fomento Economico Mexicano SA (Femsa), said Wednesday it had opened its first Mexican gasoline service station and convenience store. The service station -- a concession granted by state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, which will supply the gasoline -- was opened in the northern city of Monterrey. "We estimate that the investment in the next three years will be about $70 million, generating more than 2,000 direct jobs in the same period," the company said in a statement. Oxxo Express stores are part of Empresas Amoxxo, a strategic partnership between Femsa and Amoco. The service station is the first of eight the company plans to set up this year in Guadalajara, Saltillo and Mexico City. --Martin Langfield, Mexico City newsroom 525 7289558
