French wheat prices firmed on Thursday after traders asked for the second week running to export large tonnages of wheat at this week's EU grain tenders, dealers said. French wheat was also supported by fresh demand from Italy and Poland due to quality fears over German wheat and disappointment over the quality of Spanish and Italian wheat crops, they said. Wheat into Rouen for September delivery was quoted at 900 francs per tonne, up 7.50 francs on Tuesday. October-December delivery also fetched 900 francs, up 12.5 francs on Tuesday. Traders bidding in France asked to export to non-EU countries 257,800 tonnes of EU wheat at taxes ranging from 0.06 to 1.28 Ecus per tonne and 50,000 tonnes of wheat with unspecified subsidies. They also bid to export 31,000 tonnes of wheat to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries with refunds ranging from 3.90 to 12.27 Ecus per tonne. -- Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432
