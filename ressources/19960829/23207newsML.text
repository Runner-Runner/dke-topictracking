Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is cautious at the moment about forming a large supplementary budget for this fiscal year to boost the economy, a senior policy-maker of the biggest party in Japan's ruling coalition said on Thursday. "There are no strong calls within the Liberal Democratic Party to form a large supplementary budget. The prime minister is not currently thinking along those lines, either," Kaoru Yosano, deputy chairman of the party's policy affairs research council, told Reuters. He added that he saw no downward risks for Japan's economy, although worries had begun to emerge over future prospects after Wednesday's release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly "tankan" survey of corporate sentiment for August. The tankan showed that the business outlook among major manufacturers had worsened since the previous survey in May, with the August diffusion index for major manufacturers at minus 7.
