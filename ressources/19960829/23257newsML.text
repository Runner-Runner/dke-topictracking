Vietnam's trade gap widened to $3.246 billion between January 1 and August 10, according to data issued by the Government Statistics Office on Thursday. The figures showed exports in the period at $3.872 billion and imports at $7.118 billion.   The deficit increased sharply from last month when Vietnam reported a trade gap of $2.159 billion for the period between January 1 and July 10. The office said in a statement on Thursday a prime factor behind the latest figures was an increase in imports of machinery, and other equipment and materials by foreign companies with nascent projects in Vietnam. The deficit in that sector was put at $676 million, representing 20.8 percent of the total deficit, the office said. A trade ministry official said in July that Vietnam's trade gap was expected to widen to $3.4 billion-$3.5 billion this year from $2.3 billion in 1995.
