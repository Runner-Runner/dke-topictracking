The NYMEX oil complex settled sharply higher Thursday as a heating oil-led rally pulled up crude oil and gasoline prices, and traders said they expect the market to continue in a general uptrend. "I think it will continue," said Tom Bentz of ING Derivatives, who expects pullbacks to be followed by rebounds. "Whether it continues tomorrow is another story, but the bullish market has held support at every level, coming right back up," he said. September heating oil led gains, settling up 1.63 cents at 63.67 cents a gallon.   September heating oil reached a contract high of 63.85 cents during the day, and it closed handily above the previous intraday high of 62.85 cents. The September refined product contracts expire at the end of Friday's session. Resistance for September heat was pegged at 64.10 to 64.20. October crude closed up 44 cents to $22.15 barrel, and it's contract high is $22.55. September gasoline closed up 1.39 cents at 63.72 cents a gallon. "Heating oil made new highs, and it looks like it's just a matter of time before crude does as well," Bentz said.   Traders said the rally in heating oil was ignited by strength in gas oil futures on London's IPE. Crude's rise was helped in part by news that the United Nations is investigating U.S. charges that Iran aided Iraq in violating sanctions forbidding transport of crude and crude products, traders said. However, experts caution that it is unlikely that the U.S. charges against Iran and Iraq would affect the food-for-oil deal. -- Harry Milling, New York Energy Desk, +1 212-859-1761
