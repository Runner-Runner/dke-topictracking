Dutch shares closed lower on Thursday after strong U.S. economic data dented confidence already shaken by weaker than expected corporate profits. Dealers said the AEX index had been bobbing around in a tight range when trading company Hagemeyer and biochemical group Gist-Brocades issued disappointing interim results. Although financial services group Fortis Amev then exceeded forecasts with its earnings, stronger than expected U.S. July home sales and GDP data pushed bond and share prices lower. "That was a natural reaction with interest rates picking up again," said one dealer. The index finished at 558.95 points, down 4.43 points or 0.79 percent. The corporate earnings season had impressed the market until now but the dealer said he believed earnings estimates had been raised too high. Heineken ended 3.50 down at 374.50 in what a trader saw as a response to negative reports on hotel and restaurant trade. Financial stocks also closer lower after earlier strength. Another dealer expected the Dutch market to lose more ground on Friday, with 550 points seen as the next support level. "There's a renewed fear coming into the market and we've had a good rally in the last couple of weeks," he said.
