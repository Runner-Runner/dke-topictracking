NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended higher Thursday in a sluggish session, lifted late by concerns about storms churning in the Atlantic and short covering ahead of a holiday weekend, industry sources said. October climbed 4.2 cents to close at $1.907 per million British thermal units. November settled 3.2 cents higher at $2.046. Most other deferreds ended up by 1.5 to four cents. "The majority of the buying had to be short covering, but the whole world is bearish, and we could see more downward pressure next week because of the (mild) weather," said one Texas trader.   While Hurricane Edouard was no longer a threat to the U.S. Gulf, at 1100 EDT Hurricane Fran, with winds of 75 mph, was 300 miles east of Antiqua, moving west-northwest at 15 mph. Forecasters said they expected Fran to strengthen. In addition, Tropical Storm Gustav was lined up behind Fran on a northwesterly course with winds of 45 mph. Technically, traders said the market was oversold and due for a technical bounce, particularly with a long holiday weekend looming and storms brewing in the Atlantic, but most agreed 10-day forecasts for mostly normal to below-normal U.S. weather were likely to put cash and futures on the defensive when September flows begin next week. They still pegged October support at $1.82. Resistance was seen first at $1.955 and then in the $2.08-2.09 area. U.S. Gulf Coast September cash prices notionally were steady Thursday in the $1.75-1.80 area. Midcontinent prices were unchanged to down slightly in the low-to-mid $1.60s. But activity in all regions was extremely light. The 12-month strip rose 1.2 cents to $2.033. NYMEX said 21,630 Henry Hub contracts traded, down from Wednesday's final tally of 23,630. NYMEX Permian natgas was untraded Thursday, but October settled two cents lower at $1.58, while deferreds ended steady to down two cents. On the KCBT, October finished 2.3 cents lower at $1.642, while deferreds closed down by one-half to two cents. The East/West spread widened by 6.5 cents to 26.5 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 158 lots traded, down from Wednesday's 165. --J Silha, New York Power Desk 212-859-1624
