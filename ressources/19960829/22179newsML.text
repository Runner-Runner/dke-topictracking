The dollar closed mostly flat on Thursday after an early rally against the mark failed amid large losses on domestic stock and bond markets, dealers said. The greenback rebounded from overnight selling against the Japanese yen to end the session with a slight gain. The Bank of France reportedly bought francs for marks, halting the recent franc slide. Dollar/mark rose in sympathy. French President Jacques Chirac also boosted the franc and the dollar with a statement to French ambassadors asserting France would meet the January 1999 deadline for complying with the terms to enter proposed European monetary union, or EMU.   "In particular, the French actions probably set the tone. It was an action to limit the mark's gains," said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd. But the dollar edged lower late in the trading session as the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 23/32 and the Dow Jones industrial average slid over 70 points. The dollar closed at 1.4767/74 marks, down from 1.4767 at the open. The dollar rose to 108.37/47 yen from 108.23/35. Fresh signs of U.S. economic strength helped lift the dollar early by raising expectations for higher domestic interest rates in coming months, dealers said.
