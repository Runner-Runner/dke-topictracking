Road transport group Koninklijke Frans Maas NV said on Thursday it maintained its previous forecast that 1996 full-year profits would show a substantial increase compared with 1995's despite lower turnover.   The company's 1996 first-half net profit rose to 13.9 million guilders from 8.7 million in the year-ago period on two percent higher turnover of 619 million guilders. "We expect the favourable results trend to continue in the second half of the year, partly because the effects of ongoing reorganisations are becoming increasingly visible," Frans Maas said in a statement. The company, in which flag carrier KLM Royal Dutch Airlines owns a 32 percent stake, posted a 1995 total net profit of 17.9 million guilders after suffering a 14.4 million loss in 1994. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
