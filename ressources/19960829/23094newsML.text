Diversified manufacturer GUD Holdings Ltd said on Thursday that its outlook was positive as long as the Australian and export markets continued to firm. "A slight firming of the Australian and export markets was evident in the fourth quarter," chairman Bruce Lithgow said in a statement. "Should this trend continue, then the outlook for our businesses is positive."   The recent takeover of appliance maker Sunbeam Victa Holdings Ltd would also help current year earnings, Lithgow said. "With a strong balance sheet and competent management, we are confident that we will enhance shareholder value during 1996/97," he said. The company earlier reported an annual net profit of A$10.63 million, up from A$10.16 in the previous year.
