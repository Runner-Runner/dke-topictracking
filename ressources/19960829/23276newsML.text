Japan's Agriculture Ministry is considering using a satellite to monitor grain output in the Asia region, a ministry official said on Thursday. The ministry will launch three-year feasibility study next year, spending 13 million yen for fiscal 1996/97, he said. "We'll start analysing satellite pictures of Indonesian farm land next year as a first step. Our final goal is to establish a system to gather information about Asian grain output," he said. Japan currently depends heavily on the United States Department of Agriculture for such information.
