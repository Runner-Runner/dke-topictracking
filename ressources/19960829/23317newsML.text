Taiwan computer giant Acer Inc fell at mid-morning on Thursday after the company slashed its 1996 profit target by half, which brokers said was far more than they expected. After 60 minutes, Acer had fallen 40 cents or 1.12 percent to T$35.2, while the overall index was off just 0.29 percent.   Acer said after Wednesday's close that its board had agreed to slash the company's 1996 profit target to T$3.0 billion on projected sales of T$68.52 billion, compared with an earlier target of T$6.0 billion on sales of T$80 billion. "The market had widely expected Acer's profit target cut, but the cut -- at 50 percent -- was higher than the expected 30 percent or so. There is some pressure for it to fall slightly further," said Albert Lin of Golden Securities. -- Taipei Newsroom (5080815)
