Germany's Audi AG, seeking to expand its international presence, said on Thursday it will announce in a few years plans for two or three foreign finishing plants but has ruled out a U.S. plant for now. "You can be sure that plans for two or three new plants will announced in the next few years," Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel said in an interview with Reuters. Demel said Brazil, where parent company Volkswagen has extensive operations, and India were "interesting candidates" but said there would be no new plant in the U.S. before 2000. "We are thinking about several potential sites, but we could imagine building where VW is currently located," he said. The Ingolstadt-based luxury carmaker earlier on Thursday said group pre-tax profit rose 58 percent to 405 million marks ($273.8 million) as foreign sales expanded amid a downturn in the German market. Audi said worldwide sales rose to 9.3 billion marks from 8.2 billion marks in the 1995 period as 246,597 vehicles were sold, a rise of 6.3 percent over the 1995 six-month period. Foreign vehicles sales rose to 55 percent of total sales from 51 percent in year-ago period, reflecting strong demand. But sales in Germany fell 2.1 percent to 110,262 vehicles. The carmaker, invigorated by its award-winning A4 vehicles, said however that its share of the German car market in the first half of the year fell to 5.8 percent from 6.4 percent. Demel said Audi's nominal German market share would likely fall in 1996 to about six percent from 6.3 percent in 1995. But he expected 1996 sales to climb more than five percent with return on sales topping the 1995 level and said 1996 would be "a strong year" in Germany. He noted that 1995 was "an even stronger year" in the domestic market due to the new the A4. Despite the foreign expansion, Demel said Audi was commited to Germany and would build a new German paint factory by 1999 that will have a minimum investment of 300 million marks. "We want to do everything to build as many Audis in Germany as possible and also build as many vehicles in foreign countries as needed," he said. But Demel said, "One must build cars as close to the market as possible. You cannot supply markets in South America or Asia only from Ingolstadt." Brazil is widely rumoured to be the top site for a plant to build the new compact A3 sedan, modeled on the platform of the VW Golf. Top Audi officials have said potential A3 production in Brazil could reach about 25,000 to 30,000 vehicles per year. Audi is eyeing the South American market as a lucrative region to sell the three-door vehicle, which fills a void at the lower price range of the carmaker's premium product line. The European launch of the A3 is set for early September. Demel declined to predict potential investment in new plants, which would likely assemble car pieces from other countries, but said it would likely be self-financed. The foreign expansion is also aimed at reducing Audi's exposure to the strong mark, which burdened 1995 profits by about 300 million marks. Demel said he did not expect any burden on its 1996 results from currency market volatility. The A3 comes at an important time for Audi since Demel said he expected actual production of A4 saloon and estate cars to peak in 1996 after about 270,000 vehicles in 1995. He also dismissed speculation Audi planned an even smaller vehicle. The A3 is expected to account for 20 percent of total Audi output by 1998. It plans 100,000 of the vehicles this year. Demel downplayed concerns about the A3 taking eating into sales of the A4 or the VW Golf. "There is always going to be some overlap when one introduces a new model," Demel said. But he did not expect the same sort of dramatic growth spurt in sales seen after the A4 was introduced. "The positioning of the Audi brand name in the market is more important than volume growth," he said. "We want the A3 to play the role of drawing in younger and more dynamic buyers into the Audi premium product line." ($1=1.4791 Mark)
