A federal judge has refused to dismiss a securities fraud class action suit against Cyrk Inc and present and former officers and directors. A statement from the plaintiffs said Judge John Martin of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Cyrk's motion for dismissal. Plaintiffs include those who purchased Cyrk shares between May 10, 1994, and May 1, 1995. The plaintiffs accused the company of failing to disclose that in October, 1994, Philip Morris Cos Inc, Cyrk's largest customer, had informed it about the advent of a competitive bidding process for advertising and that it would not continue its contracts with Cyrk beyond the end of 1994.
