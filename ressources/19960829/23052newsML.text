Australin Treasurer Peter Costello said on Thursday the July current account deficit of A$1.282 billion was a good result and that the deficit was heading in the right direction.   "The balance for July, A$1.2 billion, is a good result," Costello told reporters. "It's substantially lower than it was last year, but of course these things move around," he said. "It's heading in the right direction and we think it's important that we lock in a lower current account deficit by boosting domestic savings, and that's what our budget strategy's all about," he said. Costello said the net income deficit, the cost of servicing Australia's foreign debt, was the problem for Australia.   "The balance of payments moves around from month to month but what we can say is that it's substantially less than it was last year. "I expect it will move around over forthcoming months but that's a good sign that it's substantially lower than last year. If we can build savings we can keep lower," Costello said. "And if we can build savings and address our current account problems we can grow the Australian economy faster. That's our economic strategy," he said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
