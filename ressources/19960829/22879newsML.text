Chemicals group NV DSM said on Thursday it was finalising the acquisition of an unspecified majority stake in Spain's Derivados Del Etilo SA (Deretil). Deretil is mainly active in production and marketing of intermediates for semi-synthetic antibiotics. The company has annual sales of more than 100 million guilders and a workforce of 270 people, DSM said in a statement.   "The acquisition of Deretil is a further step in the implementation of the strategy of DSM's business group Fine Chemicals, which aims to further expand its activities through organic growth and acquisitions," the Dutch firm added. It said Deretil would be a perfect fit with the activities of DSM Andeno, a unit of DSM Fine Chemicals. The acquisition would make DSM Fine Chemicals market leader in the sector of intermediates for semi-synthetic antibiotics. No financial details of the transaction were disclosed. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
