The Dutch central bank said it left its special advances rate unchanged at 2.50 percent for a five-day money market pact it will launch at tender on Friday. Subscriptions to the new special advances pact will be open between 0700 and 0730 GMT on Friday and allocations will be announced shortly afterwards. The new liquidity pact will replace a seven-day facility of 3.16 billion guilders expiring on Friday. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
