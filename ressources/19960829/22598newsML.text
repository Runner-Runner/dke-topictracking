Aluminum Co of America and the United Autoworkers union have extended a contract covering workers at a Cleveland forging plant, after negotiations this week failed to produce a new agreement, a company spokeswoman said. The current pact, originally set to expire last Tuesday at midnight (EST), was extended until midnight on September 4. Negotiations are ongoing, spokeswoman Joyce Saltzman said. The contract covers 1,100 autoworkers at the plant, which makes forged aluminum parts for several industries including the auto industry. Pittsburgh newsroom -- 412-471-7088
