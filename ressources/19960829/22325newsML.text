Endocare Inc said Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared its temperature monitoring probes, called TEMPprobes, for sale. Endocare said TEMPprobes are a key component of its CRYOcare Temperature Monitoring System, which provides the cryosurgeon with information regarding the temperature in and around tissue that is targeted for cryoablation. The use of temperature monitoring during prostate cryosurgery gives cryosurgeons a higher level of control over freezing, which has been associated with higher levels of clinical success and fewer complications, Endocare said.
