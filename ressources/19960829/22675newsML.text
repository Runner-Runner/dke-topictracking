California state Treasurer Matt Fong said nearly $33 million in public works board energy efficiency revenue bonds were sold on Wednesday to finance improvements to energy systems in the state. Proceeds of the bonds will be used to finance the cost of energy and water conservation, cogeneration and alternative energy supply source equipment for various college, university and department of corrections projects. The sale netted a true interest cost of 5.38 percent. The bonds were sold by an underwriting group led by Goldman Sachs & Co along with Great Pacific Securities, E.J. De La Rosa & Co Inc and Stephens Inc.
