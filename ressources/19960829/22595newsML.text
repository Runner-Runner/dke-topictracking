The Justice Department is proceeding with a civil rights investigation into the Los Angeles police department prompted by the O. J. Simpson murder trial, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday. She told her weekly news briefing the investigation was continuing and added, "We are working with officials in Los Angeles." She declined to predict how long the high-profile probe would last. The Justice Department has been investigating whether there has been a pattern of civil rights abuses by the Los Angeles police department. Allegations of police misconduct first were raised during the Simpson trial last year. At issue are alleged incidents described in tape recordings of former Los Angeles detective Mark Fuhrman played at the trial. He alleged blacks had been singled out for arrest without cause, boasted of police tampering with evidence and cited possible lying in court about the abuses. The investigation formally began last October, right after former football star Simpson was acquitted on charges of killing his former wife and a friend of hers. Reno said she understood the Justice Department had been receiving the cooperation it needed from the Los Angeles police department. She said she had been given regular updates on the probe by Associate Attorney General John Schmidt and Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.
