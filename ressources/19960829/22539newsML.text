The spot Saudi riyal was unchanged against the dollar this week but riyal interbank deposit rates rose between 1/16 to 1/8 point in line with higher U.S. interest rates in quiet summer trade, dealers in Saudi said on Thursday. "The market was very quiet because of holidays. There was no change in spot riyal," one Riyadh-based dealer said. The spot riyal was 3.7504/06 to the dollar. One-month rates were quoted at 5-9/16, 7/16 percent, three months at 5-11/16, 9/16 percent, and six months at 5-7/8, 3/4 percent. One-year funds were put at 6-1/8, six percent.
