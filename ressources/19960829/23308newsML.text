Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp said on Thursday it had closed one of two offshore crude oil unloading units near its Taoyuan refinery due to undersea pipeline leakage. "The unit was closed after we found minor leakage in its undersea pipeline," company official Liao Pei-feng said. Unloading of a 250,000-tonne oil tanker was halted and the vessel moored nearby after the leak was discovered on Wednesday, a manager at Taoyuan oil refinery said by telephone. The leak was controlled within an hour and cleanup crews were using chemical and enzymatic agents to break up the oil. "Only minor oil spills were reported," he said. Chinese Petroleum has two oil unloading units at Taoyuan, a port in northern Taiwan where it has a major refinery. Operation of one of the units was unaffected. Repairs were under way and the affected unit would reopen soon, the manager said. -- Taipei Newsroom (2-5080815)
