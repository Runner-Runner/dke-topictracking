Hong Kong-based fund Regent Pacific, which has taken a 3.02 percent holding in UK investment bank Hambros Plc, wants a meeting to discuss the bank's strategy, the Financial Times said on Thursday. The newspaper quoted Jim Mellon, who runs Regent Pacific with his father James, saying Hambros appeared "an undervalued and undermanaged enterprise." Hambros reported a fall in pretax profits for the year ending March 31, 1996 to 20.6 million stg from 37.1 million stg previously. But it predicted that changes to management and strategy would begin to improve earnings when it announced the results on June 5. Regent Pacific said it had neither the means nor the inclination to bid for the bank, however. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427717
