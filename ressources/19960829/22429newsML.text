UK consumer credit data are expected to show a strong pick up in July, providing further proof consumers are back on the high street and eager to spend. Reuter's consensus forecast suggests net consumer credit of 800 million stg in July compared with 636 million stg in June and 691 milion stg in May. The figures will be released on Friday at 0830 GMT. June saw the first drop in demand for new credit since January, leading economists to conclude the high level of retail sales seen that month was financed from higher incomes. But the drop may have been a one-off. "Although real disposable incomes are growing again, thereby reducing the need for credit, firmer expectations of future wage growth should still increase the willingness of households to finance consumption by credit," said Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders. Wade expected only a small recovery in credit to 650 million stg in July. But other economists predicted a bigger acceleration in consumer credit, based on British Bankers' Association lending figures already released. "High street spending slowed from the breakneck pace in June, but the breakdown of credit from the BBA suggests demand for credit held up strongly," said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets. That data, which offer an incomplete picture of credit demand, showed consumer borrowing of 539 million stg in July, more than double June's figure. But Wade said there were downside risks to the July data. Sales of houshold goods, traditionally financed on credit, slipped 0.4 percent in the month and could result in a softer-than-expected July credit figure, he said. -- Rosemary Bennett +44 171 542 7715
