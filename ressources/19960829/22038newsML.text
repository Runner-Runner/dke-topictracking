Britain wants India to permit official international observers to monitor local polls next month in Kashmir, but New Delhi has refused to admit any, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Thursday. "We would prefer to see official international observers but that is not currently on offer," Rifkind, on a two-day visit to the Indian capital, told Reuters in an interview.   On Wednesday, a spokesman for the government of Jammu and Kashmir state said foreign individuals would not be barred from observing assembly elections which start on September 7, but that teams of official observers would not be permitted. "We would certainly like to see observers present," Rifkind said, adding that Britain would be watching the assembly polls, the state's first since a separatist revolt erupted in 1990, with interest to see if they were free and fair. "The Indian government have said at the moment that they are not contemplating international observers but that any person who wishes to go to Jammu and Kashmir and see the elections can do so on their own authority," Rifkind said. "So there will be plenty of people from the international community, I suspect, present on the day."
