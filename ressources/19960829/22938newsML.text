Mercedes-Benz AG Chairman Helmut Werner denied speculation that he would leave his post, telling a German newspaper on Thursday he has a lasting relationship with Daimler Chairman Juergen Schrempp. In an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper, Werner responded to talk he and Schrempp are having difficulty getting along. "We have a certain enthusiasm for constructive conflict. Slamming doors are not a solution." The German press has increasingly speculated that Werner would leave Mercedes because he is upset that his unit is having to support unprofitable units such as Daimler-Benz Aerospace. Daimler-Benz will announce its half-year results in London at 1000 GMT on Thursday. --Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525
