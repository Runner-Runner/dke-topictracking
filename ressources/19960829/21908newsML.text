Business on the European meals and feeds market remained quietly this afternoon with only light trade reported, market sources said. "The market is still slow and there seems to be no way to bring fire back into it. Most of the business we see is hand-to-mouth buying," one broker said. Arrived Argentine sunmeal pellets traded unchanged at $160 a tonne cif Rotterdam, Oct/Dec at $161 and Jan/March at $164 a tonne cif. Spot Thai tapioca pellets traded 0.25 marks down at 23 marks per 100 kg fob Ghent.   Afloat citruspulp pellets traded well under midday's seller ideas at $112 a tonne cif Rotterdam due to pressure on promt material as several vessels are due in Europe in the coming weeks, while demand is limited.--KAREL LUIMES +31 20 504 5832.
