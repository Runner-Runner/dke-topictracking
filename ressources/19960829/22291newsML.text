Hurricane Edouard will be mainly a threat to shipping as it track east of the Bahamas' and the USA mainland this period, however it still bears watching. Top winds near the center of this system are still 125 mph and only slight weakening is expected during the next 48 hours. The expected track is close enough to the Bahamas' and the USA to cause rough seas and some beach errosion. If the track is any further to the west the North Carolina coast may be threatened.   Hurricane Fran, with 75 mph winds, continues to track towards the islands of the northeast Caribbean. It is currently about 375 miles east of Antigua. It is expected to track north of the Virgin islands in 36 hours but this is not certain. If this track holds the effect on the islands would be limited to rough seas, locally heavy rains and gusty winds. If the track is a little further south than currently expected the islands would have more serious weather, including possible hurricane force winds. There is a refinery on St. Croix in the northeast Caribbean. The system is expected to pass north of there, but this is not certain.   Tropical Storm Gustav, with 45 mph winds, is 740 miles west southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, moving northwest at 10 mph, and is expected to continue a northwest track while slowly strengthening today. This storm is a threat to shipping only. Tropical storm Orson is centered about 850 miles southeast of Tokyo, Japan, and is drifting northwestward. Top winds, now 60 mph, are expected to weaken to 55 mph during the next 72 hours as the storm continues to move slowly to the northwest. Orson threatens shipping only. Tropical Depression 22W will be a minor concern for shipping as it maintains top winds near 30 mph while moving from near 27n/174e to 31n/170e this period.
