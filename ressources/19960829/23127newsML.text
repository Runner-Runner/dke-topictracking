High sulphur fuel oil prices were expected to edge higher, tracking firmer paper levels amid bullish sentiment triggered by the fall in stock figures, traders said on Thursday. Singapore's September paper was quoted at $106.00/$107.00 against its Wednesday's quotes at $104.25/$104.75. In the cash market, traders expected prices to edge up by a dollar from Wednesday's quotes at $103/$104.50 per tonne.   The latest weekly figures from the Trade Development Board of Singapore for the week ended August 28 showed a fall of 984,000 barrels of residue stocks to 9.07 million barrels. Traders said the drop is "significant'. Despite the shutdown of Yukong's 30,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) residue desulphuriser until September 1, the refiner told Reuters the company does not have additional fuel oil to sell in the spot market. "We have already committed our September availabilities," he said.   Pockets of Chinese demand were seen in the market but bids remained too low, traders said. --Singapore newsroom (65-870-3082)
