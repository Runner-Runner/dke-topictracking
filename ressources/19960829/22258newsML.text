Wall Street analysts slashed their ratings and earnings estimates on Housecall Medical Resources Inc on Thursday after the company warned of an earnings shortfall. Housecall earlier said it expected a net loss in its fiscal fourth quarter earnings, well below previous expectations. The stock was off more than 50 percent in late trading, down 7-3/4 to 6-3/4. CS First Boston analysts downgraded Housecall to a hold from a strong buy and market sources said Dean Witter dropped its rating on the company to neutral from accumulate.   Morgan Stanley said it cut its rating to underperform from outperform. "It is our opinion that the current problems at (Housecall) are longer-term rather than shorter-term in nature and that these problems are the result of the company's strong rate of growth, which exceeded existing management's ability to effectively operate the various businesses," CS First Boston analysts Lucy Olwell and Hoard Capek said in a report. They cut their earnings estimate for Houscall's fiscal year 1996, ended June 30, to $0.44 a share from a previous forecast of a $0.63, and fiscal 1997 to $0.50 from $0.94.   The CS First Boston analysts also cut their five-year estimated growth rate on the home healthcare services company to 12 percent from 25 percent. Dean Witter analyst Todd Richter said he dropped its fiscal 1996 estimate to breakeven from a $0.30-a-share profit, and fiscal 1997 to $0.40 from $0.90. The earnings warning from Housecall was "very surprising and very disappointing," he said. The Atlanta-based company, which went public in April at $16 a share, said its non-Medicare infusion therapy, hospice and nursing services businesses failed to meet budgeted revenues. It also cited a limitation on Medicare reimbursement for some services provided during its fiscal fourth quarter. Housecall said it hopes to complete a financial review by September 12 to explain lower-than-expected earnings. -- R. Jacobsen, 212-859-1733
