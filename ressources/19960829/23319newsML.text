With 306 days to go before the British colony reverts to China, the Hong Kong media focused on handover issues, China-Taiwan relations and the departure of the head of the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR). The Beijing-funded WEN WEI PO said Hugh Davis, leader of the British side of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, had been heard talking about his choice for the post of Hong Kong's post-1997 chief executive. The paper said this was overriding Hong Kong people's sacred right to choose the chief executive through the Selection Committee and said Britain should stop interfering and show some sincerity in handing over the administration to China. The middle of the road HONG KONG ECONOMIC TIMES said the way the Government announced the resignation of the chairman of the KCR, Kevin Hyde, showed its relationship with Hyde was not a good one. It said there had been lack of communication between the Government and the KCR over the proposed Western Corridor Railway project. It said that the Government should avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future and be more open with the public about such plans. The English-language SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST said the Taiwanese business community's call for Beijing to renew top level talks with Taipei deserved to be listened to by political leaders on both sides. It said the sooner Beijing and Taipei could begin talking again the better it would be for everyone doing business. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 2843-6441
