Protective equipment and eyewear maker OPSM Protector Ltd said on Thursday that it expected growth in earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of over 10 percent in the 1996/97 year. "Year on year, I would see the EBIT increase over 10 percent," said OPSM chief executive Jeff Kelly at a briefing.   OPSM Protector's EBIT rose 23 percent in the second half of the year to June 30 over the second half of 1994/95, up from a rise of five percent in the first half. Kelly said that he did not see such stong EBIT growth continuing in the first half of the year to June 30, 1997, but that the company continued to target EBIT and earnings per share growth of over 10 percent per year. Kelly also announced that OPSM would launch a new type of store over the next two months in Australia and New Zealand. "OPSM FaceIT will be a sunglass sales operation that will be directed primarily at a younger market", Kelly said.   A FaceIT store would be opened in Sydney by September in time for the summer sunglass rush and two stores were planned for New Zealand. Kelly said each store would cost about A$100,000 to set up and it was hoped they would be profitable within their first year of operation. He said OPSM was planning to set up four or five such stores this financial year and would then assess their progress.   Earlier on Thursday OPSM posted a A$22.13 million net profit for the year after a A$5.21 million abnormal loss linked to restructuring costs and property revaluations at its Skelmersdale plant in Britain. This was down from the A$24.46 million net profit posted in 1994/95. OPSM also declared a 7.5 cents per share final dividend, up from 7.0 cents a year earlier, taking the total dividend up to 13.5 cents from 13.0 cents.   "The directors have demonstrated their confidence in the direction of the company through declaring an increased final dividend," Kelly said. He also said the company was actively looking at acquisition opportunities worth up to A$50 million to A$70 million. "Given our gearing, the company could easily handle A$50 million to A$70 million without having recourse to shareholders," he said. "We're looking for anything in that region," he said, adding however that OPSM would only consider opportunities in very similar businesses to its current ones.   OPSM's debt to equity ratio stands at around 20 percent. OPSM's shares were unchanged at A$2.50 at 3.05 p.m. (0505 GMT). -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800
