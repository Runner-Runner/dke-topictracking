Chinese Petroleum Corp said on Thursday it expected to be able to resume unloading crude at its north Taiwan oil port on Saturday, now that an undersea oil leak that shut it down has been stopped.   "Our repair team has fixed the leak," a Chinese Petroleum manager said by telephone from the Taiwan oil monopoly's refinery at Taoyuan, which relies on crude from the pumping facility located several hundred metres offshore. "We have injected water to pressurise the pipeline to test for leaks," he said. The manager said he expected oil unloading to resume from one 250,000-tonne tanker on Saturday if no further leakage is found. "Normal operations should start on Saturday," he said.   Oil leakage discovered on Wednesday forced engineers promptly to shut down one of two unloading units and other problems forced a shutdown of the second on Thursday. The problems in the second unit, which involved pipeline connectors, could not be repaired on Thursday, officials said without giving further details. The shutdown forced a halt to unloading of a 250,000-tonne oil tanker, Sailor, which was moored nearby, a manager at the Taoyuan refinery said by telephone. The leak was controlled within an hour and cleanup crews were using chemical and enzymatic agents to break up the oil. "Only minor oil spills were reported," the manager said. Chinese Petroleum officials said the shutdown in the crude oil unloading process would not affect the company's supply schedule or prices at crude oil tenders. "A delay of few days would not disrupt our supplies, nor affect prices," the official said. -- Taipei Newsroom (2-5080815)
