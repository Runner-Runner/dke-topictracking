Americans looking for management jobs are older and can look forward to getting hired sooner and with a better salary than in nearly two decades, employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said Thursday. "The typical mid to upper-level job hunter is male, and his age has crept up from 43 in 1980 to 47 today, an indication of the impact of ageing Baby Boomers on the job market," said James E. Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray. The average job search time for finding new employment has fallen to a record low 2.7 months from 3.6 months in 1980, when the company began tracking employment information. A typical manager will earn a salary of at least $69,000 -- equal or better than in his or her previous job for many comparable positions, Challenger, Gray said. This compares with $43,000 in 1980. "Our profile of the typical job hunter helps shatter several myths about today's employment picture," Challenger said. "Executives and managers nearing 50 or older are much in demand and are finding well-paying jobs after searching just a short time." The average discharged executive or manager will have spent eight years with his most recent employer, compared with 11 years in the early 1980s, the company said. "There is more mobility in today's job market and executives and managers are finding that a relocation often results in increased opportunities in a more secure future," Challenger said.
