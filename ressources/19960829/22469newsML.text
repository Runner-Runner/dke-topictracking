British and Hong Kong financial regulators said on Thursday that two units of Hong Kong-based investment bank Jardine Fleming were guilty of procedural breaches for which fines and compensation payments of more than US$20 million were due. Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission said it had agreed that Jardine Fleming Investment Management (JFIM) should pay three clients a total $19.3 million following dealings by one its former fund managers that were to their disadvantage. The clients include two publicly-held funds, the JF Pacific Securities Trust and the FFF-Fleming Pacific Fund. After a five-month investigation the SFC concluded that Colin Armstrong, who was also a former director of the investment banking arm, had allocated certain deals to these customer accounts after an unfavourable price movement relating to the deal had occurred. Allocations to his personal account had meanwhile benefitted from a favourable price movement after execution of the deals, the SFC found. The disciplinary move came as Britain's Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) said it had fined the Jardine Fleming Asset Management arm and three other Fleming units a total 700,000 pounds ($1.09 million) for breaches relating to a total of nine portfolios managed on their behalf by JFIM. Fleming said the breaches related to monitoring of JFIM and inadequate disclosure of commission. Jardine Fleming said in a statement that it accepted the criticisms and had now undertaken a "major review" of its dealing and monitoring preocedures. "This has been a very painful experience for our group. We very much regret the regulatory breaches. We are glad to have been able to put the matter right..." Jardine Fleming Holdings managing director Henry Strutt said in the statement. ($1=.6412 Pound)
