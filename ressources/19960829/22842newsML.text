Norway's state-owned Statoil has found oil and gas in the Tyrihans North field off mid-Norway, the state Petroleum Directorate said on Thursday. "The drilling has provided important information for further development of the Tyrihans find," a statement said. It said the well was drilled to a depth of 3,805 meters and that oil and gas were found. A production test in the oil zone yielded 250 standard cubic meters per day through a choke measuring 12.7 millimeters. Statoil, or Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap AS, said separately in Status Weekly newsletter that work was underway to find a development solution for the two Tyrihans fields. The aim was to submit a plan for development and operation early next year. Both Tyrihans North and Tyrihans South in blocks 6407/1 and 6406/3 on the Haltenbanken are covered, it said. "Work on various solutions is continuing," Harald Mork, who heads a team for the two fields, told Status Weekly. "We've looked at an independent development using a production ship, but we'll also consider subsea systems tied back to Statoil's Aasgard installations." Tyrihans South was proven in 1983 followed by the northern structure the year after. Recoverable reserves are put at 95 to 125 million barrels of oil and roughly 26 billion cubic meters of gas. Operator Statoil has a 50 percent holding, including 30 percent as the government's direct financial interest. Total has 33.33 percent and Norsk Hydro 16.67 percent. -- Oslo newsroom +47 22 42 50 41
