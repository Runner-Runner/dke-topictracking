Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from Norwegian offshore oil and gas production are expected to climb due to more intensive production techniques, Stig Bergseth, head of exploration and development at Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap ASA (Statoil), said on Thursday. "We are expecting an increase in the years to come as we have to invest more energy to recover oil and gas from fields as they deplete," he said. Efforts to clean up the environment resulted in a 22 percent fall in CO2 emissions between 1985 and 1995, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. But concern about a rebound in harmful emissions levels must be set against "the irreversible loss of hydrocarbon resources by refraining from recovering marginal reserves," Bergseth said. And new technology can help cap emissions, he added. Carbon dioxide contained in natural gas at the Sleipner field is being extracted offshore and injected into an aquifer, reducing emissions by 700,000 tonnes a year, or around 10 percent of emissions from the Norwegian shelf. New fields are being equipped with turbines which are able to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by about 80 percent, said Bergseth. -- Rosalind Russell, Stavanger
