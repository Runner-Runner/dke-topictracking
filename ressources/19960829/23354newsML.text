The Bank of Israel said it repurchased government bonds worth 150 million shekels from offers totalling 267 million. The central bank had said it would repurchase bonds worth up to 250 million shekels, at market prices. But only 150 million shekels worth of the bonds were offered at market price or less.   The central bank said total offers were for bonds in 11 different series ranging from seven to 14 years. It added that the criteria by which the bonds were chosen, under the right price conditions, depended also on the yield with the aim of keeping the yield curve as smooth as possible, and on the principle of buying from as many suppliers as possible. Traders say that the supply of bonds above market price is by provident funds who do not really want to sell bonds but rather to call attention to their plight. The central bank announced recently that it would intervene in the market to repurchase government bonds for the amount of 750 million shekels through three tenders. Two of the tenders were held earlier this week and last week. Last month the central bank intervened with two tenders worth 500 million shekels. The tenders, part of a security net policy for bonds, are to stop falling bond prices caused by provident funds -- long-term savings funds with tax benefits -- that are dumping bonds to meet huge public redemptions. -Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
