Shares in contract mining and civil engineering group Macmahon Holdings Ltd topped turnover in morning trade on the Australian Stock Exchange on Thursday with 7.34 million shares traded. Brokers said Macquarie Equities, which is underwriting a converting preference share issue for Macmahon, was the most active broker in the stock, crossing several parcels of a million or more shares.   Macmahon said on Tuesday it planned a converting preference share issue to raise A$44 million with the money to be used to fund continued growth and to partially reduce debt. "Macquarie is underwriting the issue and the trades could well be part of some arbitrage play," said a Sydney broker. Of the 44 million converting preference to be issued, 34 million were to be issued to Macquarie clients with the remaining 10 million shares offered to Macmahon shareholders. The issue is priced at A$1.00 per share. By 12.00 p.m. (0200 GMT), Macmahon ordinary shares were five cents higher at A$0.97 on turnover of 7.35 million shares. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
