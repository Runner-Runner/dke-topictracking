More than $4 million in U.S. military medical equipment will go to American Indian health care facilities this year, the Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday. The equipment was made available after the Defense Department closed bases in Germany, Turkey, South Korea and Britain, the department said in a statement. This is the fourth year of a program to redistribute medical supplies through the Indian Health Service; last year, the project distributed more than $6 million in health-related equipment, the statement said. The Indian Health Service, part of the health department, is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska natives.
