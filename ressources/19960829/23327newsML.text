Guangdong Investment Ltd will seek a separate Hong Kong-listing for its China toll roads when it completes its planned purchases of two highways in Guangdong province, local newspapers reported on Thursday. The company planned to buy a 50 percent stake in the 146-km Shen-Shan West highway and hoped to reach an agreement before the end of the year, the Chinese-language Apple Daily quoted Tang Zhen, deputy general manager of Guangdong Investment, as saying. He estimated the purchase price would be at least two billion yuan, the paper said. It quoted him as saying the six-lane highway, scheduled to open in October, would provide an internal rate of return of 18-19 percent. Guangdong Investment, the listed arm of Guangdong province's trading congolmerate, is also in the market to buy a stake in another toll road in the province and was examining three highway projects. No decision had been made. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 2843 6369
