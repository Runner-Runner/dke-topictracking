Construction workers building a road through marshland in China's northwestern Qinghai province have been feasting on the eggs of several endangered species of wild birds, the China Youth Daily said on Thursday. In May and June every year, labourers wade through marshland in Maduo county, loading hand-held tractors with the eggs of swans, grey cranes, wild geese and other endangered species, which they fry up for dinner, the newspaper said. The marshland, near the source of the Yellow River, is a breeding ground for over 30 types of waterfowl. Swans and grey cranes are protected species in China but most people consider it acceptable to eat their eggs, it said. "The situation might improve but ultimately it depends on people's own awareness," the newspaper quoted a local wildlife official as saying.
