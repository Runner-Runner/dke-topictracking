Japan's Indonesia Petroleum Ltd (Inpex) said on Thursday it had discovered natural gas and condensates in a field located off the eastern shore of Kalimantan, Indonesia, together with France's Total SA. Inpex said in a statement that two drill stem tests of the well -- the Stupa-1 off Balikpapan -- yielded a flow rate of 27 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 2,596 barrels per day of condensates. The participating interest in the well is held equally by Inpex and Total Indonesie SA, a subsidiary of the giant French oil firm. The two firms are operating the block under a production sharing contract with Indonesia's state-owned oil firm Pertamina.
