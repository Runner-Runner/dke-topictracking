Takeover rumours pushed property and healthcare group Parkway Holdings Ltd's shares up on Thursday morning, dealers said. But by 0220 GMT, Parkway shares retreated to Singapore $4.46 after rising to a high of S$4.68 on 1.4 million shares in the early minutes of trading.   Dealers said Malaysia's Berjaya Group could be accumulating shares for a possible takeover. They attributed Berjaya's interest to a synergy of its pharmaceutical interests, namely through its associate Pantai Hospital Bhd. Parkway Holdings owns Gleneagles International Pte Ltd which runs the Gleneagles chain of hospitals. Parkway officials were not immediately available for comment. --SIngapore newsroom (65 8703080)
