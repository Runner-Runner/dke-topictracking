Japanese prosecutors on Thursday arrested the former head of AIDS research in Japan for questioning about the deaths of haemophiliacs who were given HIV-contaminated blood products, a police spokesman said. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office arrested Takeshi Abe for using blood products which had not been heat-treated on haemophiliac patients knowing that the products could be tainted with the HIV virus. Abe has been under investigation for possible professional negligence since complaints were filed against him by the family of a haemophiliac who was given untreated blood products at the hospital where Abe worked. His arrest was the first case in which a doctor was arrested on suspicion of criminal charges in a decade-long scandal in which more than 2,000 haemophiliacs contracted HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS. Prosecutors swooped on Abe's residence in Tokyo early on Thursday morning and plan a search later on the Health Ministry and Teikyo University, where Abe used to serve as vice president, NHK public television said.
