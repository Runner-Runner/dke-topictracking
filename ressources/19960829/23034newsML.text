Australian publishing group Rural Press Ltd said on Thursday that it would be difficult to achieve profit growth in the first half of 1995/96 to June 30. "The first half will be more difficult to get growth on a year on year basis than in the second half," managing director Brian McCarthy said after the release of annual results.   McCarthy said the first eight weeks of the 1996/97 year to June 30 had not shown any growth over the same eight weeks of the previous year. "It's still very quiet in these markets," McCarthy said. "I'll be hopeful we can get some sort of recovery towards Christmas," he said.   Earlier on Thursday Rural Press reported a six percent higher net profit for 1995/96 of A$31.52 million. It also posted a six cent per share final dividend for its ordinary shares, and a 6.6 cent per share dividend for its preferred shares, compared with an 8.5 cent per share final dividend per ordinary share in 1994/95. There were no preferred shares in the previous year. Earlier, Rural Press said in a statement it anticipated the company's history of profit growth would continue. Rural Press posted a 14 percent increase in operating profit to A$52.7 million in 1995/96.   McCarthy said newsprint prices were likely to fall in 1996/97, helping to boost profit growth. He said higher paper prices had increased costs in 1995/96 by about A$6 million. "We would recover about A$1 million of that A$6 million back this year," he said. He also said the acquisition of Macquarie Publications last year would boost profit growth in the current 1996/97 year. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373 1800
