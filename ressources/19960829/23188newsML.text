Tokyo precious metal futures ended mostly mixed on Thursday in lacklustre trade as the market continued to suffer from a lack of fresh incentives and prolonged static prices, traders said. Gold futures ranged from four yen per gram lower to four yen firmer. Benchmark August finished two yen lower at 1,341 yen. Reflecting a lack of interest by private investors, open interest in gold futures has continued to decline. Open interest in TOCOM gold futures fell to 413,725 lots as of August 28, down from 437,651 lots on August 20.   "If the current static price movements continue, open interest in gold futures is likely to fall below 400,000 lots in the near future," an analyst at a commodity broker said. Spot gold was quoted at $388.25/55 per ounce at the Tokyo close, against $387.90/388.40 in New York on Wednesday. Gold prices are likely to move within narrow ranges between $387 and $390 in the near term amid a dearth of fresh factors. For palladium, some traders said that Japan's demand likely to be come under pressure because of concerns over the country's economic recovery following Wednesday's weak "tankan" data.   Palladium futures ranged from one yen per gram lower to three yen firmer. Benchmark August finished one yen down at 438 yen. Platinum futures ranged from four yen lower to one yen firmer with benchmark August ending one yen firmer at 1,378 yen. Easing spot silver prices prompted profit-taking in silver futures, but private investors hunted for bargains after the benchmark August fell to the day's low of 182.9 yen per 10 grams. The benchmark August silver finished 1.5 yen lower at 183.7 yen. 	 -Tokyo Commodity Desk, (813-3432-7431)
