Leading Venezuelan insurance company Seguros Caracas, an affiliate of U.S. insurer Liberty Mutual, expects to post a 4.14 billion bolivars ($8.8 million) pre-tax profit for 1996, finance director Roberto Salas said. In 1995, the company reported a one billion bolivar loss "which we will set against this year's tax," Salas told reporters. "Because of that we don't expect our net figure to be much less (than 4.14 billion bolivars)," he added. Liberty Mutual bought an 86 percent stake in Seguros Caracas for $42 million in June 1995 after Venezuela's number two insurer was declared bankrupt and taken over by national bank deposits guarantee fund, Fogade. -- Ana Isabel Martinez, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
