The company, a real estate investment trust, said in a statement late on Wednesday that the combination was approved by 91 percent of its shareholders at a meeting on August 22. The real estate business combination provides an investment in the trust by Safeguard, along with a merger of substantially all of the combined real estate portfolios of Safeguard and Nichols and the real estate portfolio of the Trust. The transaction encompassed 19 institutional office and industrial properties and options of four properties in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.
