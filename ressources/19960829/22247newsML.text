The watery site of the ValuJet Flight 592 crash in Florida's Everglades will remain closed as personal effects of victims float to the surface, state officials said Thursday. The remote location where the DC-9 crashed on May 11, killing all 110 people on board, will likely be closed permanently by order of Florida's governor as a memorial to the victims. Homicide detectives and state wildlife officers were at the crash site Thursday picking up shirts, shoes, purses and other debris from the doomed jetliner, which nosedived into water-covered muck about 30 miles (48 km) west of Miami. The Metro-Dade County Police Department has an open criminal investigation into the crash and two federal agencies also were conducting criminal probes, according to published reports. A period of dry summer weather lowered the level of water in the Everglades, bringing more crash debris to the surface. "We're still finding personal items," said Lt. Col. Woody Darden, regional director of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. "We expect that to continue for some time as weather conditions change." Darden said the closure was designed to protect the integrity of the site and also because it still represented a human health hazard. In the days after the crash, the site was a mire of toxic chemicals and decaying human remains. Officers picking up crash debris wear protective clothing. In June, officials closed a 97,000-acre wildlife refuge surrounding the crash location for 90 days, an order due to expire in early September. At a meeting on Sept. 12, Florida's governor and cabinet were expected to declare the immediate crash site a permanent burial ground for the victims, some of whose remains were never found. Darden said a 5-10 acre site would be fenced and a memorial to victims erected there.
