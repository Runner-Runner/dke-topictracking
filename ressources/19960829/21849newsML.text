U.S. fixed-rate mortgage rates rose this week as signs of strong economic growth fuelled inflation fears and boosted interest rates, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Thursday. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.09 percent in the week ending Aug. 30, up from 7.93 percent last week. Fifteen-year loan rates also rose, to an average of 7.60 percent from 7.45 percent. But adjustable mortgage rates inched down to 5.75 percent from 5.79 percent last week. A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 7.76 percent, the 15-year 7.27 percent, and the adjustable loan 5.86 percent. "Continued vigour in the economy, as evidenced by the upward revision to the GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate and strength in new home sales in July helped to push interest rates higher this past week," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist. "Still, with 30-year rates around 8 percent, consumer confidence up and strong economic growth, home sales should continue at a good pace," Nothaft added. The Commerce Department Thursday revised U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product to a 4.8 percent rise from a previously reported 4.2 percent increase. It also said that U.S. July new home sales rose 7.9 percent after falling 1.8 percent in June. The Conference Board, a private business research organisation, Tuesday said the U.S. August Consumer Confidence Index rose to a six-year high of 109.4. It was 107.0 in July. Freddie Mac said lenders charged an average of 1.7 percent in fees and points on 30- and 15-year loans, both unchanged from last week. They charged 1.4 percent on the adjustable loan, also unchanged from the previous week. Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said the volume of total U.S. mortgage applications fell 5.1 percent in the week ended Aug. 23. The volume of applications to refinance mortgages fell 6.1 percent in the latest survey week, while applications to purchase mortgages fell 4.8 percent, the trade group said.
