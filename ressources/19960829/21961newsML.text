The German farm ministry on Thursday said changeable weather during harvesting could impair the quality of this year's grain crop. Agriculture minister Jochen Borchert said, "Quality this year will probably not reach that of last year's harvest although there are wide regional differences." "Weather patterns have been harassing farmers this year and in some parts lost them the fruits of their labour." If harvests kept being disrupted by bad weather, rye and triticale, but also wheat, could suffer. But malting barley should have both higher yield and quality. In a preliminary estimate, Borchert put the grain harvest three percent up at 41 million tonnes, adding this was due to a 2.7 percent area increase to 6.7 million hectares. Pan-German yields of 6.1 tonnes a hectare should be unchanged but those in eastern Germany, where the winter was extremely harsh, should be 10 percent below last year's average in the region of 6.0 tph. Borchert said a period of warm and dry weather was now needed to ensure grain still in the field -- roughly one third of the total crop -- reached a reasonable quality. Eastern German farmers should suffer 7.6 percent volume losses at 13 million tonnes, because large parts of the winter barley area needed to be resown, the ministry said. Farmers in the West may be luckier and raise their crop by 8.7 percent to 28 million tonnes. The harvest is currently two to three weeks behind schedule as a result of a cold and dry winter and a cool and wet spring. Sporadic, but heavy, rainfall in July and August caused some hail damage and lodging. --Vera Eckert, Bonn newsroom, +49-228-26097146
