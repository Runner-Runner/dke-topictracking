Danish cable-laying group GN Store Nord on Thursday raised its 36 percent share of mobile telephone company Sonofon to a controlling 51 percent, with the purchase of investment company Incentive's 15 percent holding, an Incentive statement said. It said the price, depending on further evaluation, would be between 383.4 million and 415.8 million crowns. GN Store Nord said that the purchase was part of its strategy of increasing its presence in Denmark's recently liberalised telecoms industry. The group on Thursday announced first-half, pre-tax results up to 121 million crowns, from 98 million crowns during the same period last year and said it also expected full-year profits to show an increase. -- Uffe Hansen, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650
