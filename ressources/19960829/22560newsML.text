Without this provision, second-quarter net profit would have been 148.3 million shekels and first-half net would have been 318.2 million shekels.   Leumi, Israel's second largest bank, said results were positively affected by a decline in operating expenses, excluding the one-time expense for the redundancy programme; a drop in provision for doubtful debts; improved results from most subsidiaries; and increased income from financing and extraordinary transactions. Net return on equity in the first half was 6.6 percent on an annual basis, against 8.7 percent a year earlier. Shareholders' equity rose to 6.9 billion shekels from 6.7 billion at the end of 1995. Total consolidated assets were 122.1 billion shekels against 120.6 billion at the end of 1995. Deposits from the public on June 30 stood at 95.8 billion shekels against 94.4 billion at the end of 1995 while credit granted to the public rose to 73.2 billion shekels from 71.0 billion. Net assets of its mutual funds amounted to 4.5 billion shekels and of its provident funds (long-term savings funds with tax benefits) to 24.6 billion.
