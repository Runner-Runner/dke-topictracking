Warm, dry weather was forecast for much of the U.S. Midwest through next week with chances for isolated showers, meteorologists said. "Obviously, there is no threat of any frost damage (to crops) during the next two weeks," said Basilio Lopez, Smith Barney meteorologist, in his published forecast. High temperatures in the 70s and 80s (degrees Fahrenheit) were forecast for the Midwest Thursday and Friday and then gradually rising next week with highs near 90 degrees. Lows should range from the upper 50s to mid 60s, forecasters said.   Lopez said 75 to 80 percent of the Midwest should remain dry the next seven days. Meteorologists said the warm, dry weather should benefit much of the corn and soybean crops, which need warm conditions to speed development. Because of late spring planting and a cool summer, much of the corn and soybeans are about two weeks behind normal in development. Craig Solberg, Freese-Notis Weather meteorologist, also forecasts a warm, dry pattern the next 10 days. But, he said there were some dry areas in the eastern Midwest that could use moisture.   The spring wheat areas in the northern Plains may receive light scattered showers, "but nothing to seriously delay the (spring wheat) harvest," said Solberg. Hurricane Edouard continued to move northwest, but meteorologists said it may turn north running near parallel to the U.S. eastern seaboard. "It probably will not have a big impact on any land area," said Solberg. Close behind Edouard is Hurricane Fran, with 75 mph winds and was about 350 miles east of Antiqua early Thursday. Solberg said it was too early to forecast Fran's impact on the United States. --Chicago newsdesk 312-408-8720--
