Yukong Ltd, South Korea's largest oil refiner, said on Thursday it had closed down its 30,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) residue desulphuriser due to trouble with a high-pressure valve. A company spokesman said the unit is expected to resume operations on Sunday.   "We ran into some trouble with the unit's high-pressure valve," he said. "But it's not serious and the unit will restart on September 1." The spokesman said the brief closure was unlikely to affect the refiner in terms of oil products supply and sales. Yukong also has a new 60,000 bpd residue desulphuriser, which started operations earlier this month. It has a total residue desulphurising capacity of 90,000 bpd. --Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5643
