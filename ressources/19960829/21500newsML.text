At least seven people died and two dozen others were injured in overnight clashes between armed rebels and military and police in two southern Mexican states, national media reported on Thursday. National radio and television networks Radio Red and Televisa said guerrillas, wearing ski-masks and believed to be from the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), carried out coordinated attacks on military and police bases just after midnight in the poor states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. Casualties were reported from both sides.   Radio Red said seven people died in clashes in a handful of isolated villages and towns. Televisa said six died. One unnamed witness speaking live on radio from the town of Tlaxiaco in Oaxaca said she was still too afraid to leave her house. "They were masked members of the EPR ... they went to take the town hall ... there was a massive gunbattle," she said. Televisa said a statement from the Guerrero state Attorney General's Office confirmed the attacks but said one person died and 11 were injured. Televisa said two policemen, one marine, one civilian and one armed rebel died in one attack on the police station and naval base offices in the tourist resort of Huatulco, Oaxaca.
