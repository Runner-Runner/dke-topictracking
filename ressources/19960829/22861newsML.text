Finance Minister Jean Arthuis on Thursday presented industry heads and unions with a draft bill on the introduction of private pension funds in France, Le Monde afternoon daily newspaper reported. The bill should be examined by parliament in October or November, the newspaper said.   Back in early July, Arthuis said he expected private pension funds, which could invest in shares and bonds, to be in place in France at the start of next year. Le Monde said that the bill presented by Arthuis on Thursday allowed for "retirement-savings plans" at the company, sectoral or profession level, in addition to an existing system involving a social security-backed pension and top-up retirement schemes.   The newspaper said the bill foresaw funds based on employee contributions, allowing employers to contribute but with a ceiling of six times the contributions from staff. It said the bill also sought to create additional security by having such funds externally managed for companies. The tax treatment side of the matter had yet to be decided, but the 1997 budget should include clauses on exemptions from income tax for contributions and on company tax. Le Monde said the text did not spell out how the assets of these funds could be placed. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
