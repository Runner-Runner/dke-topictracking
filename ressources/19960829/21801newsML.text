Jordan signed an amendment to its PL-480 Food for Peace agreement with the United States to provide for sale of $8 million in U.S. rice, the Agriculture Department said Thursday. The amendment would allow sale of about 19,000 tonnes of U.S. rice. The supply period was set as fiscal 1996, which ends September 30. USDA said the amendment increased Jordan's PL480 Title I allotment to $21 million. Purchase authorizations would be announced later, USDA said. Sales would be made through private traders.
