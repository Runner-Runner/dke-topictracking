The Soviet Union accused its communist satellite East Germany of treason in the 1980s for dismantling some border fortifications at a time of Cold War tension, a former East Berlin defence minister said on Thursday. East Germany agreed in the early 1980s to remove minefields and trip-wire triggered machineguns from its border with West Germany as part of an attempt to improve inter-German relations. But Moscow was at the time trying to stop the NATO western alliance siting a new medium-range missiles on German soil. Ex-defence minister Fritz Streletz testified to a Berlin court trying four former communist leaders that then-Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko had angrily criticised East German party boss Erich Honecker and accused him of treason. "Sparks were flying at the highest level," Streletz said. The court is trying four former Politburo members, including East Germany's last hardline communist leader Egon Krenz, on manslaughter charges. Prosecutors say the men bore responsibility for the deaths of East Germans who were killed at the border during the Cold War as they tried to flee to the West. The defendants argue that the border regime was run to Moscow's specifications and that East Germany had no choice but to maintain it. Streletz has himself been sentenced to 6-1/2 years for manslaughter in connection with the deaths at the border, but is free pending an appeal to the constitutional court.
