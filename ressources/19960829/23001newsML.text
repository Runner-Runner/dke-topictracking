Shares in engineeering and aerospace group Rolls-Royce Plc were marked down two pence to 229-1/2 pence in pre-market dealing after the group delivered first-half results broadly in line with expectations but failed to raise its dividend. One analyst said the market will await the company's meeting with analysts later on Thursday before making up its mind on the results, saying the results statement "didn't say a lot". Rolls-Royce posted a first-half loss of 169 million pounds compared with profit of 70 million a year before, after an expected 248 million pound charge for discontinued operations.
