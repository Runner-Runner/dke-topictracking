Beijing plans to build an industrial park and a science park housing Taiwan-funded companies, the overseas edition of the official People's Daily said on Thursday. Vice Mayor Lu Yucheng told a seminar on Beijing-Taipei economic cooperation that the Chinese capital would give preferential treatment to Taiwanese investors in the parks, the newspaper said. It did not elaborate. Beijing would also set up a service centre to provide consultation and legal services to Taiwanese investors. Taiwan businesses "can expect lucrative profits in Beijing", the Xinhua news agency quoted Lu as saying. Taiwan had invested more than $1.3 billion and set up 1,587 firms in Beijing by the end of June, Lu said. Trade volume between Beijing and Taiwan totalled $100 million in 1995. The newspaper quoted Lu as saying Beijing sought cooperation in car and electronic ventures. On Wednesday, Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan told the seminar that Beijing should resume talks with Taiwan lest the island's investors lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties. The talks were suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui enraged China by making a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. Kao is head of a delegation of nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians who are on a high-profile 12-day visit to China.
