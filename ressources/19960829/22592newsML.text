U.S. West Coast light crude prices came off early highs on Wednesday afternoon, but remained generally strong on concerns a new storm could disrupt supplies in Gulf and Caribbean facilities. The bellwether West Texas Intermediate crude traded at $21.70/21.80 a barrel, or 30 cents over Tuesday levels. But Alaska North Slope (ANS) differentials continued unchanged at $2.05 a barrel off October WTI, the level of last week's deal.   Buyers saw the delta falling as low as $3 on supply excess, affirmed in last week's inventory report from American Petroleum Institute (API). API data showed a crude build of 5.2 million barrels on the West Coast. Local refiners saw operating capacity rise 4.8 percent to 86.1 percent last week, reversing a signficant drop in mid-August. Some traders said that could help lower backed-up crude supplies.   "Maybe some of the longness could go away, but the pendulum won't swing to the other end," one trader said, referring to stocks. One domestic refiner was heard offering Kuwaiti crude because of flush stocks. Line 63 differentials were unchanged at WTI minus $2.60/2.50 a barrel, with little trading seen ahead of mid-September. -- David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles +1 213 380 2014
