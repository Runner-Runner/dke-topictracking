Dutch bonds held on to most of their earlier gains at the close despite a weaker U.S. bond market in the wake of strong U.S. economic data. Middle maturities were particularly sought out as investors edged up the curve for extra yield to take advantage of persistent steepness. The June 2002 bond closed some 20 basis points higher at 112.91/113.01 for a bid yield of 5.56 percent on switches out of shorter maturities. The spread between the benchmark January 2006 Dutch bond and the April 2006 bund widened to -8 basis points from -6.   News of a robust 2.8 percent year-on-year rise in Dutch second quarter GDP had little impact on bond prices. Dealers said the economic scenario in Germany in the third quarter would be more important for the market's direction. "We've been in a range (for 10-year Dutch yields) of 6.25 to 6.75 percent for half a year now," said one dealer. "If German growth picks up but inflation stays under control, as we expect, then we'll see a stronger market. But if inflation gathers pace, you can forget it," he added. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
