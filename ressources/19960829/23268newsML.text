China's life insurance sector will be boosted by interest rate cuts in May and August this year as people withdraw bank deposits and look for alternative investment opportunities, the China Daily said on Thursday. "The resulting drop in bank deposits will give more people the opportunity to purchase life insurance policies," it quoted Tan Linzhuang, vice-director of China's Planning Committee for Economic Strategy, as saying. As China establishes a social security system that requires people to take more responsibility for their own welfare, life insurance would provide security for individuals and safeguard personal funds, it said. However, the insurance industry must improve its services and increase consumer awareness to compete in the market economy, the newspaper said. A recent survey showed only nine percent of the population in China's 50 major cities had life insurance, for which they paid 300 yuan ($36) or more a year, it said. Last Friday, the central People's Bank of China cut bank deposit rates by an average 1.5 percentage points and lending rates by an average 1.2 percentage points.   It was the second interest rate cut this year after the bank lowered interest rates on deposits and loans in May. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)
