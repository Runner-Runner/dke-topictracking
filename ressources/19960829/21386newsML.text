Russia's security supremo Alexander Lebed may fly to rebel Chechnya on Friday to continue talks with local separatists, Interfax news agency said on Thursday. Lebed has sought in vain since last Sunday a clear endorsement from President Boris Yeltsin for his plan for a political settlement in the region. He gave a warning on Wednesday that any further delays in talks could derail a military accord which is being implemented.   The agency, quoting Lebed's press service, said a final decision on the date of his trip would be taken later on Thursday. Lebed struck a military accord with the separatists last week only to return suddenly to Moscow on Sunday saying he needed approval from Yeltsin and other top state officials for a broader plan dealing with political issues. Yeltsin, on holiday outside Moscow, appeared reluctant to meet Lebed or even talk to him by telephone. The president's press secretary said on Wednesday that Yeltsin was studying written documents and needed more expert advice.
