An Israeli negotiator said after talks with his Palestinian counterpart on Thursday a joint steering committee would begin meeting next week to oversee implementation of self-rule deals. Israeli negotiator Dan Shomron described the hour-long talks with his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat as "good" and said they had discussed "mutual obligations to the peace process".   Shomron, a former Israeli army chief, and Palestinian Local Government Minister Erekat convened just hours after the end of a four-hour strike in the West Bank and Gaza against Israel's policies towards the Palestinians. "There will be more meetings...we intend to work continuously and already next week there will be another meeting of the entire committee," Shomron, who chairs the committee with Erekat, told reporters. "Our role as a steering committee is to solve problems and continue the peace process, to do this in a good spirit," Shomron said. "I believe after this meeting that we have the ability to advance all the issues that today are found at differerent levels of implementation." Erekat told reporters: "I think we need much less words and a lot more deeds. I need to say that Palestinians and Israelis want to be reassured about the status of peace...by both sides being committed to the reciprocal implementations of the agreements that are signed."
