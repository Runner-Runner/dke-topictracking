Tokyo stocks closed lower on Thursday, as concern about Japan's economic recovery lingered in the market following Wednesday's weak "tankan" data. Most buyers retreated to the sidelines, and the sluggish trade is expected to continue until September, brokers said. The key 225-share Nikkei average shed 156.65 points or 0.76 percent to end at 20,553.16, after drifting between 20,503.62 and 20,706.99. Its September futures lost 130 points to finish at 20,590. "People are gauging where the bottom of the market is," said Kenzo Doi, senior analyst at Kokusai Securities Co Ltd.
