Weary firefighters battling 46 major fires in seven western states got welcome news on Thursday when the Department of Defence agreed to send a battalion of U.S. Marines to the firelines to help in the effort. Army Col. Randy Gordon, the Department of Defence co-ordinating officer with the National Interagency Fire Centre, said the Marines, from Camp Pendleton, California, would train at their base on Friday before being moved to the firelines over the weekend. It is the second military battalion to be called up to fight the current fires, which have charred nearly 655,000 acres (265,000 hectares). An Army battalion from Ft. Carson, Colorado, is currently fighting wildfires in Oregon. A battalion consists of about 530 soldiers. In California, a 15-year-old boy pleaded not guilty in court to setting a fire on Monday in a scenic area 60 miles (96 kms) northwest of Los Angeles with a cigarette lighter. By noon on Friday it had spread to 20,000 acres (8,090 hectares) and was still burning out of control. A judge in Sylmar, California, ordered the teenager, who was not identified because of his age, held in a detention centre for his own safety, noting the strong public sentiment against him. Firefighters battling the blaze in the Lake Castaic area also had to contend with bees, scorpions, 100 degree Fahrenheit (37 C) temperatures and wildly shifting winds. Two other large fires burning in northern California brought the total acreage charred by current fires in the state to 89,700 acres (36,000 hectares). Firefighters in Nevada were attempting to handle 13 blazes on Thursday that had blackened a total of 206,000 acres (83,000 hectares), including 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares) in the Upper Humboldt complex 10 miles (16 kms) east of Battle Mountain. The fire, which was only 25 percent contained, was threatening the community of Crescent Valley, a Federal Aviation Administration control facility, three mines and three ranches. A total of 12 fires in Oregon were burning on Wednesday, covering 202,600 acres (82,000 hectares). The largest was in the Hell's Canyon National Recreation Area, where flames had ravaged 68,525 acres (27,730 hectares) and were threatening historic structures, electronic facilities and the area's big game winter range. So far this year, 84,640 wildfires have consumed more than 5 million acres (2 million hectares), compared to the five-year average of 59,400 fires and just under 2 million acres (809,000 hectares).
