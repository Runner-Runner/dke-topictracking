German equities ended bourse trade mixed on Thursday, after a strong earnings report from Daimler-Benz AG triggered profit-taking on the giant industrial group's stock instead of giving the market a much-needed lift. The 30-share DAX index, which tracks Germany's 30 blue chip shares, ended the bourse session down 3.10 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,560.06, as declines in the car and chemical sector offset gains among financial shares. Daimler's first-half earnings news conference at midday was the main focus of the day. A rush of interest in the run-up to the results sent Daimler stock as high as 81.80 marks, but the shares weakened after the earnings data were released and ended the bourse session down two pfennigs at 81.30. The company, which had the biggest annual loss ever for a German company in 1995, reported six-month operating profit of 827 million marks -- at the top end of expectations. Dealers said there was no logical reason for the drop. "Buy the rumour, sell the fact," commented one Frankfurt trader. Other car shares also fell. Volkswagen, earlier boosted by a report of a 58 first-half profit rise at its Audi unit, ended the session down two marks at 549.50 marks. Chemical shares were also notably under pressure, which dealers attributed to profit-taking after the sector's recent popularity. The DAX 100 chemical index, which tracks the chemical firms among Germany's top 100 listed companies, dropped 0.7 percent to 1,421.78 points. Hoechst fell nearly two percent to 52.05 marks. Financials benefitted in part from the shift out of chemicals. The DAX 100 bank share index rose 0.4 percent to 1,143.87. Shares in electronics and engineering giant Siemens AG fell 86 pfennigs to 78.42 on reports that Iran was suing the company for 5.4 billion dollars for failing to complete a nuclear power plant abandoned after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
