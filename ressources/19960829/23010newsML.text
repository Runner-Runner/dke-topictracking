British retail group Sears Plc is closing around 200 shoe shops which have returned to its control after their buyer Facia fell into financial troubles, the Times newspaper reported. It said the shops were being offered for sale as vacant premises by chartered surveyor Healey & Baker. The Times said around 2,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the closures. Sears has undertaken to make redundancy payments which could cost it up to four million stg, the Times said, even though staff were technically employed by Facia. No one at Sears was immediately available for comment. The Times said the closures could push Sears into a loss for its half year results which are due next month. Facia collapsed with 30 million stg of debts after banks called in the receivers on June 1, a day after Sears had applied for the shoe companies of Facia to be put into administration. Sears had been in the process of selling its Saxone shoe chain to Facia but called for them to be placed into administration when it became concerned that Facia could not pay debt related to the deal.   Stylo Plc has already agreed to take on 61 properties from Sears which were occupied by two Facia group companies under administration and trading under the Saxone, Trueform and Freeman Hardy Willis logos. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427717
