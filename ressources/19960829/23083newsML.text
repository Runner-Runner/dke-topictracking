The Australian Democrats party said on Thursday it might oppose the government's plan to give a tax rebate to people who take out private health insurance. The measure -- expected to cost the budget A$113 million in 1998/99, its first year of operation -- is part of a package of government policies aimed at taking pressure of the national health insurance scheme, Medicare. "The Australian Democrats will consider rejecting the (government) Coalition's private health insurance rebate in wake of the premium increases announced by major private health companies," Democrats senator Meg Lees said in a statement.   The Liberal-National government is two votes short of a majority in the upper house of parliament, the Senate. Those two votes can come from the 28-strong Labor opposition, the seven Democrats, two Greens or a pair of Independents. On Wednesday two health insurers said they were raising their premiums, effectively taking up all or part of the subsidy that their customers might get from the government. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
