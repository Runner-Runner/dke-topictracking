The U.S. help-wanted advertising index fell to 83.0 in July against a reading of 85.0 in June, the Conference Board said on Thursday. In July, the volume of help-wanted advertising fell in five of the nine U.S. regions. "The labor market has been expanding throughout 1996, but in a very uneven pattern," Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said in a statement. "Recent want-ad figures indicate that conservative hiring plans are keeping job growth below the rate of overall economic activity."   With 2.5 percent Gross Domestic Product growth expected for 1996, new job growth should slowly lower the unemployment rate over the rest of the year. "With the unemployment rate staying close to about 5.5 percent over the last two years, there is a good chance the rate will slowly drop to about 5.0 percent by the end of the year," Goldstein said. The July index matched the reading for the same month one year prior. The greatest declines in the volume of help-wanted advertising were in the New England, Mountain and West South Central regions. The greatest increase was in the East North Central region. -- N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660
