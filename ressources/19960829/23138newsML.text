Japan's Itochu Corp said on Thursday it forged a joint venture deal with a local real estate firm to develop a one-billion peso office building in Manila's Makati business district. Ryosuke Hori, president of Makati Sky Plaza, the joint venture of Itochu and Asian Appraisal Holdings, said in a statement a 30-year old building would be pulled down to make way for a 22-storey office building which will host mainly Japanese tenants. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
