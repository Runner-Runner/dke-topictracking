Yemen said on Thursday it had received no written confirmation of Eritrea's pullout from a disputed Red Sea island. "So far we have not received any written official confirmation from any side on Eritrea's withdrawal from Lesser Hanish," Deputy Foreign Minister Abdou Abdel-Rahman told Reuters. Yemen this month accused its African neighbour across the Red Sea of committing a "glaring violation" on August 10 in Lesser Hanish, one of several disputed islands near the waterway's southern entrance. Eritrea told the United Nations on Wednesday it had withdrawn its troops in an effort to resolve the row, U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said in New York. French diplomats confirmed that the withdrawal had apparently taken place, she said. "We heard and have been verbally notified that Eritrea had verbally informed the U.N. that it had withdrawn from the island," Rahman said. But "we are waiting for an official written confirmation of the withdrawal so that the assurances become binding." Yemen had earlier hinted that it might take military action against Eritrea if mediation failed to bring about a withdrawal. On Monday Sanaa said it was pulling out of French-led mediation and vowed to force a withdrawal. The two countries fought briefly last December over the potentially oil and gas-rich islands. They later agreed in Paris in May to settle the row through arbitration.
