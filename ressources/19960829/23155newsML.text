Indonesia said on Thursday its state-run aluminium authority would produce 230,000 tonnes of aluminium in 1996 compared with 225,000 tonnes in 1995.   Abdul Rauf Suhud, chairman of the Asahan Aluminium Authority, which oversees the PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) smelter, said it was increasing production because of good electricity supply and improved technology. "We plan to produce 230,000 tonnes this year, compared with 225,000 tonnes in 1995. We are able to increase output because of good electricity supply and improved technology," Suhud told reporters after meeting President Suharto. "We are also thinking of expanding our capacity but we have not decided yet. The prospect for the aluminium market is still promising," he said. The Indonesian government has a 41 percent stake in the project, with the rest held by the Nippon Asahan Aluminium Co, a firm equally owned by 12 Japanese investors and the Overseas Cooperation Fund of Japan. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
