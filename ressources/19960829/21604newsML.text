Taiwan's money rates finished firmer on Thursday and dealers said the rates might push even higher amid tight liquidity at the end of a month. The overnight interbank rate closed at 6.150 percent compared with Wednesday's 5.827 percent close, with 30-day commercial paper at 6.50 against 6.00-6.25. The central bank on Thursday injected T$17.405 billion funds into the banking system through open market operations to ease the tight liquidity. Sentiment in the bond market was slow in the afternoon and no trades were reported. Traders expected the sluggish market to continue also over tight liquidity. -- Julie Hu (2-5080815)
