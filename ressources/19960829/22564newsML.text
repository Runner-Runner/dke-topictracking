The United Arab Emirates is expected to issue a tender next month for an expansion at the Abu Dhabi Flour Mill in a project possibly worth 146 million dirhams ($40 million), Emirates News reported on Thursday. The daily quoted a source close to the project as saying the General Industry Cooperation (GIC) "is in the process of prequalifying contractors. Three contractors have already been qualified and a tender will be put out within two weeks". The source, who did not name the contractotrs, said the project is for the installation of an added capacity to handle 400 tonnes per day and improving an existing packing facility. The mill has a current daily capacity of 400 tonnes of wheat and produces 480 tonnes of animal feed. GIC is also expected to offer three more tenders later this year to expand silo capacity at the mill to 80,000 tonnes daily by adding 16 new silos to store maize and wheat. The mill currently has 44 wheat silos, 31 flour silos and four bran silos.
