The Bank of France drained 3.7 billion francs at a securities repurchase tender held on Thursday to allocate funds for injection into the money market on Friday. It accepted bids for 40.5 billion francs in new liquidity, 3.7 billion less than the 44.2 billion leaving the market on Friday when a previous pact expires. The new pact expires on September 6. The Bank of France said it allocated 12.3 billion francs to bidders offering Treasury bills as collateral, satisfying 2.9 percent of such demand. It allotted a further 28.2 billion to bidders putting up private paper, satisfying 11.4 percent of this demand. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
