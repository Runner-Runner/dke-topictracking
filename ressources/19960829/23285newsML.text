H-shares of mainland China truck assembler Qingling Motors Co Ltd rose to a year high after the company reported a sharp increase in interim profits, brokers said. The stock rose HK$0.25, or 8.62 percent, to HK$3.15 in mid-morning trade on volume of 3.13 million shares. Qingling posted interim profit of 183.01 million yuan, up sharply from 29.65 million yuan in the year earlier period. "A weak Japanese yen, which is expected to lower the cost of importing parts from Japan, is likely to help its future earnings and that is underpinning buying," said Jason Tang from South China Brokerage. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (8952) 2843 6370
