Natural gas will continue to increase its share of Norway's hydrocarbon output, but oil is still the priority for offshore producers, Stig Bergseth, head of exploration and development at Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap ASA (Statoil) said on Thursday. "Priority in the short term has been and will be on oil," he told delegates at the 1996 Offshore Northern seas conference. Although exports of Norwegian gas are set to double to 60 billion cubic meters a year soon after the turn of the century, Bergseth said that short-term growth in west European gas demand above contracted volumes looked sluggish. "This is what we must consider when balancing gas sales and oil recovery (through gas reinjection)," he said. Statoil estimates as much as five billion barrels of extra oil could be produced offshore Norway through improved recovery. The use of reinjected gas in this process will increase from 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) to 35 bcm by 2000, said the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. While efforts are being made to maximise Norwegian oil production the country's crude slate is changing, Bergseth said. "The number of producing fields is increasing and the result will be a much broader variety of oil qualities offered to customers." Liquids production at the Sleipner and Aasgard gas fields will make Norway a significant condensate producer within a few years, while condensate production in the North sea as a whole will double to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2000. Natural gas will attract more interest as new demand emerges, he said. "The northwest European market is in our opinion well balanced, and the U.K. is not open for new imports at the moment. "The potential lies in Eastern Europe where energy consumption will be driven by economic growth and a need to diversify sources of imports, and in Southern Europe, where projected demand growth still outpaces contracted volumes," said Bergseth. -- Rosalind Russell, Stavanger
