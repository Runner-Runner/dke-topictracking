The Chicago Board of Trade said it raised the minimum initial margin requirement to trade September corn futures to $1,148 per contract from $810, effective with the overnight Project A trading session on Wednesday, August 28. Hedge and maintenance margins were raised to $850 per contract from $600. Friday is first notice day for deliveries against the September CBOT grain contracts, including corn. But Thursday is first position day, when September contracts begin trading without daily limits, traders said. (Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8720)
