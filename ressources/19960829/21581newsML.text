China is in no rush to fix a target date to make the yuan fully convertible after current account convertibility is achieved by the end of this year, a senior Chinese official said on Thursday. Zhou Xiaochuan, Director-General of China's State Administration of Exchange Control, told a news conference China was studying the merits of making the yuan convertible on the capital account. "Now we haven't finished the study yet. So we are in no rush to set up a timetable for the next stage," he said. "By international practice, the next stage usually takes longer," he said. Russia's experience raised the question of whether it was wise for a developing country to rush to make its currency fully convertible on capital account, Zhou said. China would also need to see how the yuan performed after it became convertible on the current account before it could proceed to the next stage, he said. -- Hong Kong News Room (852) 2843 6590
