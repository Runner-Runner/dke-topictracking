Elida Faberge, the toiletries unit of Unilever, has handed the advertising for three of its brands to British advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH). Previous spending on the Elida Faberge brands has totalled 6.0 million pounds, the agency said on Thursday. BBH will take over these well-known brands from rival ad agencies -- taking Salon Selectives shampoo from BMP4, Lynx Skin Systeme from Ammirati Puris Lintas and Pears Soap, the world's oldest soap brand, from J. Walter Thompson (JWT), BBH said. The move follows Unilever's appointment of BBH in 1995 to handle the launch of the fragrance, Addiction, and a TV branding campaign for the Lynx body-spray. Unilever works closely with a group of advertising agencies, with the bulk of its work handled by JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, McCann-Erickson and A. P. Lintas. BBH's group director, Julian Martin, said: "Our relationship with Elida Faberge in the UK has evolved from a single project to five ongoing brands in little more than a year." -- London Advertising Desk +44 171 542 2792
