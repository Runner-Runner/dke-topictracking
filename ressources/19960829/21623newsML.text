China's biggest power company has bought a stake in a firm that will build a plant to supply electricity to residents relocated to make way for the Three Gorges dam, officials said on Thursday. Huaneng Group purchased a controlling interest in Yichang Dongneng Co (Group) Ltd in the central province of Hubei for 30 million yuan, an official of Yichang Dongneng told Reuters by telephone. He declined to say what Huaneng's stake was. The firm would be renamed Huaneng Yichang Power Production Group Co and would build a 2,400-megawatt power plant in Yichang, where residents were being moved to make way for the construction of the gargantuan Three Gorges dam, he said. The official did not say how much the new power station would cost, when it would be completed or how many residents would be relocated. China estimates 1.1 million people will be moved during construction of the dam, due to be completed in 2009.
