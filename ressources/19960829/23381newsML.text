Greek M3 money supply growth decelerated to 8.3 percent year-on-year in July from 9.0 percent in June to stay within the central bank's 6.0-9.0 percent target range, the Bank of Greece said in a statement.   The slowdown in M3 money supply growth was linked to the deceleration of total credit expansion which was within the central bank's 5.0-7.0 percent target range, it said.
