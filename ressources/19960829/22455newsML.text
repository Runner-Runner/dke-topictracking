A leading UK cocoa forecaster saw an improvement in the upcoming Ivorian crop and said no delays were expected in the first arrivals, trade sources said. PCR Ltd, led by Robert Fish, issued an update on Ivory Coast on Wednesday based on the latest pod counts after a series of preliminary reports suggested a late and smaller harvest. The report said prospects for the 1996/97 Ivorian crop had improved thanks to heavy rains in early July that helped flower setting. "There has been an improvement," said one cocoa analyst commenting on the PCR report. "The prospects have improved. The crop is definitely not going to be late," he added. The report suggested slightly above average setting and a good survival enabling the crop to catch up. PCR is said to have pegged the Ivorian cocoa arrivals at mid-February at around 715,000 tonnes, excluding carry over from the 1995/96 season. By mid-March, the arrivals were expected to reach somewhere around 840,000-850,000 tonnes, trade sources said. The PCR report was regarded to be slightly less bearish for the trade than an earlier report published by the U.S. pod counter Hans Kilian who is said to have projected the main crop in a wide range between 790,000 and 930,000 tonnes. There was no confirmation of the Kilian report. The size of the Ivorian crop is crucial for the market already reeling from a record crop of about 1.2 million tonnes last season which sent prices spiralling down from eight-year highs in June. -- Clelia Oziel, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8072
