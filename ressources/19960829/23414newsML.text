Swiss travel and tour group Kuoni Reisen AG said on Thursday it expected an increase in its turnover, and an improvement in its profits. In a statement to present its half-year results for 1996, Kuoni said it would keep costs strictly in line to offset fierce price competition in the industry, which has weighed on margins. "The measures introduced (to cut costs) have contributed to an improvement in the results. For the entire year 1996, Kuoni is therefore confident," it said. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340
