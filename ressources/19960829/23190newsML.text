A middle-aged couple armed only with pails of boiling water kept progress at bay briefly on Thursday but failed to prevent demolition crews razing Hong Kongs Little Taiwan. Wrecking crews moved through the shanty town reducing the settlement to rubble to pave the way for developers who will erect high-rise public housing on the site. Only a few frayed and faded Taiwan flags fluttered over Rennies Mill, a now abandoned relic of a haven for thousands of vanquished Nationalist soldiers and their families who fled the 1949 Communist takeover of China. The couple held the work up for a while by barricading themselves in their home and tossing scalding water out of the windows. But as the crowbars and sledgehammers went to work, police negotiators convinced the couple their efforts were futile and coaxed them out of their home of 40 years. The remote township on the coast of Hong Kongs Kowloon peninsula was the scene of fierce resistance by residents demanding better compensation last month when more than 100 riot police battled demonstrators opposed to the clearance. Protesters had formed a human chain atop a mound of boxes and cooking gas cylinders and blocked the road to the settlement, forcing the government to postpone demolition work. Demolition crews were braced for renewed clashes when they moved into the township this week to resume the clearance but they faced little resistance.
