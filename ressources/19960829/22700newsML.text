Danish share prices closed lower on Thursday after another day dominated by a stream of 1996 interim corporate results, hit by the weak dollar and U.S. market with more falls foreseen ahead of the weekend. "It seems difficult to keep the KFX index above 120 points for very long at a time these days, we'll probably see more falls tomorrow," one dealer said. The KFX top-20 index closed 0.76 point lower at 119.27 in overall bourse turnover of 936 million crowns. The KFX September future fell 0.35 point to 119.95 with 134 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded. Tele Danmark was one of the dominant papers, closing three crowns down at 275 in solid volume on a first-half 1996 result slightly lower than average analyst expectations. Insurer Codan cheered the market with a bumper half-year result, closing 60 crowns up at 910, but Sophus Berendsen later disappointed traders and pushed the index down despite an increased profit, finishing 28 crowns down at 692.
