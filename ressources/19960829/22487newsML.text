British household products group Reckitt and Colman reported a 10.3 percent rise in underlying profits on Thursday and said its prospects were good. Profits before tax and one-off non-operating items rose to 165 million pounds ($257 million) from 149.6 million. At the pre-tax level, however, profits fell to 179 million pounds from 316.4 million, reflecting large gains from selling businesses in the first half of 1995. The company said the first-half performance began to reflect its strategy to refocus the business on its leading household and pharmaceutical brands. Its brands include such products as Harpic and Dettol and cold remedy Lemsip. "Profitability and cash generation are strong and, although the overall rate of sales growth has not yet met our expectations, the prospects for delivering higher returns to shareholders are good," the company said in its results statement. Turnover from continuing operations rose to 1.16 billion pounds from 1.11 billion. Reckitt raised its dividend by 8.2 percent to 7.95 pence, and its shares rose six to 687-1/2 pence after the results, which analysts said were in line with expectations. Mark Clark, an analyst at investment bank UBS, said, "The good news is that cash generation and cost savings from restructuring are at least up to expectations, but the downside is turnover growth."
