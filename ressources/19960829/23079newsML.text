Appliance and lawnmower group Sunbeam Victa Holdings Ltd said it expects flat retail trading conditions, margin pressure and abnormal costs to affect its results in the year to June 30, 1997. "Flat retail conditions, margin pressure and abnormal costs will impact Sunbeam's results in the current year," Sunbeam said in a statement accompanying its 1995/96 annual results. Sunbeam earlier reported a 19 percent rise in net profit to A$3.97 million in the year to June 30. The group is controlled by GUD Holdings Ltd following GUD's current takeover bid for Sunbeam.   "Nevertheless, a positive earnings per share contribution to the GUD group is expected," Sunbeam said. The GUD takeover offer is based on one of its shares plus 54 cents for every three Sunbeam share. The offer closes on September 6. "Sunbeam Victa can look forward to a bright future under GUD management," GUD chairman Bruce Lithgow said in a statement. Lithgow said restrictions on capital expenditure for new plant and productivity have impacted Sunbeam's results. But early indications confirm that substantial improvement in manufacturing processes are achieveable in the medium term.   He said Sunbeam's former directors had initiated a restructuring and retrenchment programme in July at a cost of A$1.7 million and this would be funded out of 1996/97 cash flow. Lithgow said it was decided to retain the final dividend at five cents a share, level with a year earlier, following a review of Sunbeam's financial position, capital expenditure needs and additional restructuring costs. "Our judgement is that Sunbeam has an unsatisfied need for expenditure to modernise its plant and equipment and sufficent cash had to be retained to fulfil that need," Lithgow said.   At 12.20 p.m. (0215 GMT), Sunbeam and G.U.D. shares were steady at A$1.20 and A$3.06 respectively. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
