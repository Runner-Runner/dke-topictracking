British supermarket chain J. Sainsbury Plc wants to expand in the U.S. and would be happy to clinch a deal for 12 stores there with Royal Ahold, deputy chief executive Dino Adriano told Reuters. The deal, if secured, "suits us fine because we want to expand the American business," he said in an interview. "We would be very pleased to get those," he added. Sainsbury confirmed earlier this month that it was in discussions with the Netherlands group to buy the stores. The move could bring its total number of outlets in the U.S. under the Shaws brand to 112, say newspaper reports.   Industry reports put a price tag of around $50 million on the deal. Adriano said discussions were still proceeding. He did not rule out expansion in Europe but said "thus far, using the criteria that we do in judging whether we can get some value out of our investment, we have found America the better option." Adriano said the size of the U.S. market meant that "the opportunity for getting a formula right and then rolling it out...is quite significant." But he cautioned that the U.S. market was very different from Britain. He said there were no true national chains, conditions were very competitive and customers were less loyal. -- Jo Winterbottom London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
