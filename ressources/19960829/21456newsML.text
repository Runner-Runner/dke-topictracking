Argentine industrial output rose in July and August, Industry Secretary Alieto Guadagni said, quoted by the state-owned Telam news agency Thursday. Guadagni told a conference in the seaside resort of Mar del Plata, "Industry is intact, solid and robust and its growth (over the whole) decade will be almost 60 percent." He gave no figures for output in July, but figures for the month's industrial production were due out later on Thursday. August figures are slated to be released next month. Argentine industrial output grew by 0.3 percent in June compared to June last year. -- Jason Webb, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541 318-0655
