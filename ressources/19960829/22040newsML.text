Indian sugar prices fell on Thursday on lower consumer demand and improved supplies, dealers said. "The coconut day festival (a Hindu festival held on Wednesday) is over and more festival demand will commence only next month," one dealer said. Markets were closed on Wednesday. Increased offerings by mill owners to sell off current month quotas prompted more supplies in the market. Ready delivery S-30 sugar slid by five rupees to 1,355/1,390 rupees per quintal while M-30 fell by 10 to 1,390/1,420 rupees. Overall market sentiment ended subdued. -- Bombay Commodities +91-22-265 9000
