Grain dealers in Oklahoma and Kansas said Thursday they were bracing for another season of railcar shortages. "With the way the rail structure has changed, you have to buy cars out in the marketplace," an Oklahoma dealer said. "I think that with (the merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe) set to go ahead, we'll probably have the same problem with shortages this year -- maybe worse." Meanwhile, basis bids for hard red winter wheat were unchanged overnight and farmer selling remained extremely slow, dealers said.   Basis values are quoted against KCBT wheat, cash dollars/bu.
