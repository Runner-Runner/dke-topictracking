The volume of Finnish wholesales decreased 6.8 percent year-on-year in June and the value excluding VAT of these sales fell 5.7 percent, Statistics Finland (SF) said on Thursday in a statement. The volume of retail sales fell 1.8 percent year-on-year and the value fell 0.9 percent, SF said.   Part of the fall in sales was attributable to the fact that there were two trading days less in June this year than in 1995, it said. In the first half of 1996, the wholesales volume increased 2.0 percent year-on-year and the retail sales volume rose 2.6 percent. In June wholesales, only car sales showed an increase, rising seven percent. General wholesales fell almost 17 percent and wholesales of investment goods fell over seven percent.   June retail sales were hurt by the decrease of tourism and by bad weather. Almost all retail sectors' sales volumes fell in June, SF said. Only the volume of automobile sales continued to show an increase, rising 11 percent year-on-year in June. Alcoholic beverage sales fell most, over seven percent year-on-year in June. --Helsinki newsroom +358 - 0 - 6805 0245
