China said on Thursday Japan was encouraging right-wing groups that have inflamed a dispute over South China Sea islands, and it called on Tokyo to get tough. "We have noticed recently that certain right-wing elements have repeatedly landed on these islands," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said in a reference to the Daioyu islands, known as the Senkakus in Japanese. "We believe the Japanese government should take effective measures to stop these illegal activities," he told a regular news briefing. Japanese authorities said earlier this month that the Nihon Seinen-sha (Japan Youth Federation) withdrew a claim for recognition of a lighthouse built on the islands. In July, members of the group sailed to the islands where they built a make-shift aluminium lighthouse. The islands are about 300 km (190 miles) west of Okinawa and 200 km (125 miles) east of Taiwan and are claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan. Shen added that the Japanese government was creating a climate that encouraged activities by right-wing groups. "I believe the actions and words of these Japanese right- wing groups are not accidental," he said. "This has directly to do with the stance of the Japanese government on this issue." Shen repeated Beijing's criticism of Japan for failing to address its history of aggression against China. Beijing has accused Japanese politicians of trying to whitewash their country's atrocities during the occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s. Shen said Beijing and Tokyo should put aside their differences over the possession of the islands. "We say the issue should be shelved and neither side take action."
