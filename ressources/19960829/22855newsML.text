Danish cement and engineering group FLS Industries posted on Thursday a 36 percent higher pre-tax profit for 1996's first six months and forecast continuing progress in operations for the rest of the year. "The generally satisfactory rising activity and improved earnings noted by most of the group's companies in recent years, continued in first-half 1996 as expected. This progress is expected to carry on in the year's final six months," an FLS statement said. "All in all we expect our whole year 1996 economic result to be much better than last year," it added. FLS posted whole year 1995 net profit of 412 million crowns ($72 million). First half 1996 pre-tax profits rose to 327 million crowns from the same 1995 period's 240 million, with net profit up to 207 million crowns from 190 million. Turnover was 14 percent higher, at 9.3 billion crowns. FLS said its key engineering unit had continued high earnings and income for its environmental, building materials and transport operations rose. It also said that rationalisation and better market conditions cut its British-based FLS Aerospace unit's 1996 first-half loss to 43 million crowns from 76 million last year. The statement said that new orders for base engineering maintenance and component services helped FLS Aerospace and it forecast improved performance in the 1996 second half but said its full-year result would remain a deficit, albeit reduced. The FLS share was unmoved by the interim result, trading at an unchanged 640 crowns by late morning. ($1=5.718 Danish Crown) --Chris Follett, Copenhagen newsroom +45-33969652
