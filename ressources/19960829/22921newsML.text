Vietnam's industrial output has climbed 13.4 percent so far this year over the same period in 1995, but the pace of growth has slowed, the Government Statistics Office said on Thursday. The figures showed state-sector output rose 12.7 percent in the period and non state-sector was up 13.0 percent. Industry with foreign investment saw its output rise 16.1 percent. The 13.4 percent rise for the period compared to a 14.4 increase in the first eight months of 1995. The precise period being measured was not given. The office said that slower increases in the oil, electricity, steel, coal, cement, paper and beer industries were the main contributory factors. "Steel and paper are facing tough competition from foreign products. Coal has faced problems in finding new markets for exports." the statement said. It added that the domestic beer market was reaching saturation point. A 7.1 percent increase in crude oil output to 5.539 million tonnes indicated the Bach Ho and Dai Hung offshore fields were approaching full production, the office said.
