CBOT soybean futures closed higher on rekindled concerns about dry weather in the U.S. Midwest, traders said. "It was dry weather. Skilling came out at midday and fortified other forecasts which were dry so that put another bullish slant on things," a trader said. Chicago television forecaster Tom Skilling is closely followed by local floor traders. Meteorologists early Thursday said warm, dry weather was forecast for much of the U.S. Midwest through next week with chances for isolated showers. Agronomists Thursday told Reuters that slow-developing soybean plants in the U.S. Midwest need warm nights with daytime temperatures in the low 80s (degrees Fahrenheit) and regular rainfall through September to reach maturity on time. Short covering, a technical bounce, commission house buying and active exports of soybeans and soymeal also boosted the market, they said. Long liquidation pressured September relative to other months despite prospects for light deliveries on Sep. Soybeans closed 2-1/4 to eight cents per bushel higher, with September up 2-1/4 at $8.19-1/4. Volume was estimated at 50,000, down from 57,958 Wednesday. In the soybean options pit, Refco Inc sold 200 November $8.00 calls at 27 cents and Central Soya sold 200 November $7.75 puts at 19-1/2 cents. Soybean options volume was estimated at 18,000, down from 26,683 Wednesday. Sam Nelson 312-408-8721
