French President Jacques Chirac reaffirmed on Thursday his government's commitment to meeting the deadline for European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). "France will be there and will meet the necessary requirements. It will do this because that is what corresponds to the interests of all of the French people," Chirac said. "A single currency will finally enable Europe to have equal weight with the United States in the great financial debates. It will help us achieve a more stable and fairer monetary order," he said in remarks prepared for a meeting of French ambassadors from around the world. The single currency would allow low interest rates and thus higher growth and more jobs, he said. It would put an end to "competitive devaluations," on condition that strict rules are observed on the parities between the Euro and other European currencies, as France has demanded. Basic to France's role in the world was the need for continuing development of European unity and movement toward a single currency, he said. Chirac was speaking ahead of a Sunday meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl when they are expected to discuss bilateral, European and world issues.
