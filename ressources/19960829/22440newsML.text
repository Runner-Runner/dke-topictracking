IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Thursday it had affirmed the long-term and short-term ratings of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) at A plus and A1 respectively.   IBCA also affirmed BNL's individual rating at C/D and its legal rating of 2. "Today's announcement reflects BNL's performance, which although steadily improving, remains weak," IBCA said in a statment. "BNL's net interest margin is relatively low, reflecting the bank's dependence on the interbank market for funds and a client base made up of large corporates," IBCA added. However, a marketing drive to reduce its reliance on interest revenue should enhance income generation, it said. The quality of the bank's domestic loans has also shown some improvement, although again this is still rather weak and reserve levels may need to be improved, IBCA said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6176
