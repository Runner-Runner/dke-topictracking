A budgetary stability pact is seen necessary for all EU countries which want to enter Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) at some time in the future, Dutch central bank president Wim Duisenberg said on Thursday. Budgetary discipline in Europe should likely be imposed by a stability pact that would require close to balanced budgets under normal economic conditions, he said in a prepared speech. "A consensus seems to be emerging on the necessity to strive for 'near balanced budgets'. This stability pact will then not be limited to first tier countries but will also be extended to countries that do not enter EMU from the beginning," he said. Duisenberg, who will become head of the European Monetary Institute in July 1997 and probably head of its successor the European Central Bank, also said the stability pact could play a role in selecting countries to launch the single currency. Only a few EU countries had achieved the budgetary goals set in the Maastricht Treaty, a maximum three percent budget deficit and a state debt not exceeding 60 percent of GDP, he said. Countries with a national debt larger than 60 percent should be reducing it at a 'significant pace' to qualify for EMU. If a country with an excessive deficit committed itself to a stability pact that could also be a reason to allow it into EMU, he said. "The Maastricht Treaty says the evaluation of an excessive deficit should depend on other relevant factors...If a member state has committed itself to a stability pact that will reduce its deficit to around zero in a few years time, that could be a positive factor in the assesment," Duisenberg said. "The bigger the commitment (to this stability pact), the bigger the impact of this factor," he said. An EU member state would make a very good impression if its parliament approved a national stability pact, Duisenberg told a conference in Alpbach, Austria. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
