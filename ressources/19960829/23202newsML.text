South Korea's oil products exports grew 29 percent to 108.4 million barrels in the first seven months of 1996 against 84.0 million barrels a year ago, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said on Thursday. The rise in exports of high-sulphur diesel, C-type fuel oil and naphtha led the growth, the ministry said in a statement. The ministry did not give a breakdown by each product. It said the rise in domestic oil products output and slowdown in the growth of demand were also responsible for the increase. The nation's imports rose 11.4 percent to 142.9 million barrels in the first seven months from 128.3 million a year before.
