Corporate bond debt issuance is expected to remain on hold as thinly staffed desks and an eerily quiet market keep issuers sidelined as the holiday approaches, dealers said. "There is absolutely nothing going on in the new issue market and we haven't seen any official calendar for next week," said one high-grade syndicate source. The primary market is expected to see little to no action ahead of Monday's Labor Day holiday when U.S. financial markets will be closed, and straight through the U.S. employment report due out next Friday, September 6, dealers said.   "We have progressively wound down the week for new issues with two deals on Tuesday and one on Wednesday," another syndicate source said. While August traditionally is a slow month for business, September tends to be one of the busiest months and with the end of quarter approaching dealers expect business will pick up. In addition, rising U.S. Treasury yields are expected to keep potential issuers sidelined for now as the cost of financing is more expensive, they added. Meanwhile, next Friday's release of U.S. employment data should set the tone in the new issue environment, dealers added. "If the market rallies on the jobs data there will be a lot of new issues flowing in," said one syndicate source. "We just have to see what happens next Friday with the employment numbers. That will set the tone," said one syndicate official. In July, the Labor Department reported the unemployment rate at 5.4 percent and an increase of 193,000 in nonfarm payrolls indicating a healthy U.S. labor sector. --Nancy Leinfuss, 212-859-1675
