CSCE coffee futures ended unchanged to slightly higher in quiet trade Thursday, boosted by light fund buying, dealers said. But floor sources said trade selling trimmed gains, and kept the December contract below nearby resistance at 118.50 cents a lb. Benchmark December coffee ended up 0.50 cent, to 117.05 cents, after ranging narrowly between 117.80 and 115.20. Spot September ended 0.80 cents firmer, at 128.10, while the remaining months were flat to 0.65 higher. Dealers said low Exchange inventories continued to provide support. "I think we will still see a shortage of coffee in the next two months," one trader said. Although September's open interest continued to decline, it remained relatively high Wednesday at 1,397 lots -- the equivalent of nearly 350,000 60-kg bags -- compared to the 39,313 60-kg bags of certified coffee stocks stored in CSCE warehouses.   But traders said the CFTC Commitment of Traders report due after the close of business Friday could weigh on the market if it shows a substantial increase in non-commercial long positions. "If the funds are heavily long as anticipated it would send a negative signal," the trader said. "No one will want to be long." Volume reached an estimated 6,711 lots. --Patricia Avidan, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640
