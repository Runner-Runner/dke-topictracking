The Singapore International Monetary Exchange Ltd said trading volume in SIMEX Euroyen futures hit a daily record high of 121,826 contracts on Wednesday. It said in a statement on Thursday the record volume was reached after the release of the quarterly tankan report by the Bank of Japan, which said business sentiment worsened in August. SIMEX said the previous record volume for the interest rate futures was 95,553 contracts set on May 15, 1996. "The bouyant contract has been on a record-breaking trend since its inclusion in the highly successful mutual offset system between SIMEX and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in March," it said. - Singapore Newsroom 65-8703080
