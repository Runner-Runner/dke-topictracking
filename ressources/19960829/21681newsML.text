Blue-chip stocks skidded to their biggest loss since mid-July Thursday as new data showing a stronger-than-expected economy lifted long-term interest rates above 7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65, its largest drop since July 15, when it closed with a loss of 161 points. In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point, or $7.1875 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 7.04 percent -- the highest since July 31 -- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday's close. "Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities," said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James. "We could carry another 100 points lower in the Dow," he said. "I'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday, so let's be careful." Wall Street next Friday faces the key monthly employment report, which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices. "We had two very strong economic reports," said David Shulman, Salomon Bros.' chief equity strategist. "There are more worries in bond land. Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July." The Commerce Department reported that the nation's GDP expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago. In another report, sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months, driving prices up in a strong housing market. Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February, when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year. Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning. Dick Morris, who is credited with resurrecting Clinton's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre, quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a year-long affair with a prostitute, with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents. Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton. Morris' departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term. "Clinton's right brain just fell off the truck," said one analyst, who requested anonymity. Interest-rate sensitive stocks were further pressured. J.P. Morgan lost 1-1/8 to 88, Wells Fargo was off 3-7/8 to 248-7/8, Cigna fell 2-7/8 to 114-7/8 and Merrill Lynch was off 3/8 to 62-1/4.

Baxter International rose 2-1/2 to 45-3/8 after news it will acquire Immuno International AG over three years in a deal worth $715 million. Sierra Semiconductor surged 2-5/8 to 11-7/8. The company said it plans to exit the highly competitive modem chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment. Housecall Medical slumped 7-1/4 points or 50 percent to 7-1/4 after warning of a quarterly loss. Centocor lost 3-1/4 to 33-1/8. Oppenheimer & Co. raised questions about a key study in Centocor's leading drug ReoPro and called the stock "overvalued.
