A group including Bedford Falls Investors LP said Thursday it had withdrawn its plan to nominate six candidates to the Spreckels Industries Board. The group, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it also dropped plans to pursue its proposal that the Spreckels board take steps to sell the company. The group took the move after Spreckels agreed on August 26 to be acquired by Columbus McKinnon Corp for $24 a share in cash. The group said it intends to sell its stake "through the Columbus offer or otherwise." The group said it currently holds a 7.2 percent stake in Spreckels or 455,636 common shares, following its sale of 135,200 shares on August 26 for $23.57 to $23.62 a share.
