Brazil's National Monetary Council voted late Wednesday to set up a new rediscount line interest rate for Central Bank financial assistance to banks, said Francisco Lopes, Central Bank Director of Economic Policy. Lopes said the new Rate of Assistance of the Central Bank (TBAN) would be a "sister" of the Basic Interest Rate (TBC), set up by the bank in July. The TBAN will be set at a higher rate than the TBC and will be available to banks which have drawn more than their authorized limit of rediscount lines. Lopes said it would increase self-regulation in the market, giving more institutions access to rediscount lines but at a higher cost. The TBAN will come into effect in October. -- Michael Christie, Brasilia newsroom 55-61-2230358
