Bank Hapoalim has reached an agreement with Dovrat Shrem & Co for the sale of just under 24 percent of Poalim Investments, the bank said in a statement. The sale price is 197.8 million shekels and based on a company valuation of 871.7 million shekels, the bank said.   The price is higher than the value on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange which according to press reports is $154 million. The two other bidders for the bank's excess stake in Poalim Investment were the Dankner Group and the Steinmetz brothers, who are leading diamond dealers. The bank said that Dovrat Shrem's bid was the highest. The Hapoalim board of directors is to be convened in the next few days to approve the agreement. Dovrat Shrem, with over $100 million in equity, provides full investment banking services, including underwriting in Israel and the United States, fund management and real estate development. Bank Hapoalim issued a tender for the sale of the shares in its subsidiary in line with a new banking law that requires commercial banks to reduce their stake in non-financial assets to a maximum of 25 percent. In July the Dankner Group had bought a 15 percent stake of Poalim Investment. ($1=3.14 shekels) - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
