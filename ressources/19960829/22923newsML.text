Mitsubishi Motors Corp said on Thursday it launched a completely remodelled Galant medium luxury sedan and a completely new Legnum station wagon. "We want to recover our sales and take the offensive through sales of the new Galant and Legnum," Mitsubishi president Takemune Kimura told reporters at a press preview of the new models on Thursday. Mitsubishi's domestic sales including 660cc minivehicles fell 10.9 percent from a year earlier to 457,544 in January to July period of 1996, due to poor demand for its sedans and recreational vehicles. Most versions of the new Galant are powered by its newly developed 1.8-litre "Gasoline Direct Injection" (GDI) -- ultra-lean burn engine. This can reduce fuel consumption by 35 percent from its predecessor, and reduce emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 35 percent, and increase engine power by 10 percent. "We will install this new engine technology to our other bigger-engined models and other mass-production models in the future," said Kiyotaka Takizawa, managing director in charge of passenger car development division.
