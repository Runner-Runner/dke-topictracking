Money managers made modestly defensive changes to their U.S. debt portfolios in the week ended August 27, said a survey by Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. Portfolio strategists shortened their duration exposure and increased cash holdings in the past week, the survey said. "Involvement in the market was again rather subdued, however," it said.   The report said the survey's bear/bull index arithmetic reading fell to 4.16 from 4.66 the week before, while the asset-weighted number came in at 4.44, down from the 4.65 in the previous period. A number above 5.00 is seen as indicating investors are mostly long on the market. The cash/assets ratio rose to 6.62 percent from 6.21 percent. Duration bogey held steady at 4.06 on an arithmetic basis and 4.69 on a weighted basis.   Duration bogey is the level of asset or liability duration sought in the management of a portfolio. Duration refers to a portfolio's average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk. Twelve percent of portfolio managers polled said they were planning to be active in the coming week, unchanged from the week before. The bear/bull index collected among those who intend to be active slipped to 5.33 from 5.67. The Stone & McCarthy survey is conducted by the research firm weekly. It includes 25 market participants with total assets of about $100 billion, the firm said.
