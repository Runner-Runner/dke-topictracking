Property developer Sino Land Co Ltd said Thursday it had signed a letter of intent with China's northeastern Dalian city government to develop port facilities at Xinhai bay. The US$1.1 billion joint venture project involves port-related infrastructure, but details had yet to be settled pending feasibility studies, said Robert Lee, group director of corporate development. The company, a Hong Kong flagship of Singapore property tycoon Ng Teng Fong, is optimistic about long term prospects in China but careful. "We are optimistic but selective. The key to success is in identifying the right projects in China," Lee said. The company has 10 sites in China, mostly located in Xiamen, in southern Fujian province, earmarked for property development. --HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 28436441
