President Clinton's lead over Republican challenger Bob Dole is continuing to edge higher, according to two new polls released Thursday. The latest CBS News poll showed that Clinton's lead rose three points over the past 10 days. The poll, taken Aug. 26 to 28, showed 51 percent of registered voters favouring Clinton for president in the 1996 presidential elections, 36 percent for Dole, and eight percent for billionaire Texas businessman Ross Perot. A CBS poll 10 days ago -- soon after a successful Republican convention gave Dole a boost -- had Clinton leading 49 to 37 percent, with Perot also at eight percent. Dole's favourable rating among those registered for the November election fell by three points over the same period, from 29 percent to 26 percent, whereas Clinton's remained the same at 42 percent, the poll found. The latest CBS News poll surveyed 1,803 adults, of whom 1,346 were registered voters. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points. The latest ABC News tracking poll said Clinton's lead had widened to 17 percentage points Thursday, bringing it nearly back to the level for the president before the Republican National Convention earlier this month. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
