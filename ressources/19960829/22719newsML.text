France Telecom will help local authorities to create their own independent networks for telecommunications as long as it is allowed to be the operator for at least three years, a France Telecom representative said on Thursday. Jemil Larabi, a director dealing with local authorities for France Telecom, present at a meeting in this south-west town, rejected criticism over France Telecom pricing and said some towns would pay even more by setting up their own networks. "But France Telecom is work with local authorities in looking into the construction of an independent network under certain conditions; the laying down of a set of conditions and the granting of the (network) management to France Telecom for a minimum of three years," he said.
