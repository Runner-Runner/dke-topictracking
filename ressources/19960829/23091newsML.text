Horticultural group Arthur Yates & Co Ltd said on Thursday it was too early to predict the earnings trend for the year to June 30, 1997, as the forthcoming Australian spring was their busiest period of the year. "I am unable to comment on our growth, spring is our major selling period, and we are coming into spring now, so I won't be able to tell you our earnings pattern until early in the new year," Michael Skeggs told reporters. Skeggs said demand for its vegetable and plant seeds would depend on the weather. Yates earlier reported a 52.8 percent rise in net profit to A$6.08 million in the 1995/96 year.   The Australian spring officially starts on September 1. Skeggs said given the flat outlook for the Australian retail sector it was difficult to predict strong growth. "We sell most of our products to retailers and most retailers have been saying recently not to expect much growth in the retail sector this year," he said. Skeggs said the company was still considering acquisitions, but it would not be outside the group's core horticultural business. At 11.40 p.m. (0140 GMT), Yates shares were one cent up at 97 cents. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
