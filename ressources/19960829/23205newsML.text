The utilisation rate of Japanese oil refineries was 75.6 percent in July, up from 62.3 percent in June and 74.1 percent a year earlier, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said on Thursday. Crude throughput amounted to 19.7 million kilolitres (kl) in July, up from 15.8 million kl the previous month it said. Japan's oil companies currently have a refining capacity of 5.3 million barrels-per-stream-day. As a general rule, Japanese oil companies raise the utilisation rate towards the end of year to build up kerosene stocks for the winter months.
