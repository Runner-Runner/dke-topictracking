The release of first-half results by German conglomerate Daimler-Benz AG has been delayed because reporters who were flying in from Germany have not arrived at the scheduled news conference, a reporter at the conference centre said. The German reporters were still somewhere between the airport and the news conference at 0936 GMT. The results were due out at 0900 GMT. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717.
