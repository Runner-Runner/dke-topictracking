Nickel prospector Anaconda Nickel NL said on Thursday that legal action against it in the Western Australian supreme court by Perth investor Peter Salter  over three mining leases had been discontinued.   Anaconada said it had received a letter from Salter's solicitors on Wednesday saying: "We are instructed to inform you that our client intends discontinuing the above action against both defendants." Salter's legal action disputed the ownership of three of Anaconda's tenements which hold more than half the nickel in the A$780 million Murrin Murrin nickel project. The project is forecast to produce 100 million pounds of nickel a year once it is fully operational in mid-1998. Initial news that Salter had lodged the court action depressed Anaconda's share price.   Anaconda's share's were up ten cents at A$2.30 at 2.20 pm (0440 GMT). -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800
