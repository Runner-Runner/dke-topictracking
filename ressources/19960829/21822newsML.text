Huntsman Corp., the nation's largest privately held chemical company, Thursday denied industry rumours that it wants to buy a plastics unit of Eastman Chemical Co. The speculation, which has been swirling in the industry, was fuelled further early Thursday by PaineWebber analyst Paul Raman, who wrote in a note to clients that Eastman Chemical might be seeking to sell its polyethylene business to Huntsman. Raman estimated the value of the business at $400 million. But Salt Lake City-based Huntsman, which plans to announce two acquisitions soon, denied interest in the unit. "To the best of my knowledge, we are not speaking to Eastman about this," said Huntsman spokesman Don Olsen. Polyethylene is a type of plastic used in packaging and insulation. Shares of Eastman Chemical rose to a high of $57.375 on the New York Stock Exchange before easing back to $56.375 in early afternoon. The gains came amid broader market losses. In an interview with Reuters last week, Huntsman Chief Executive Officer Jon Huntsman said the company expected to announce two acquisitions in the next 30 days. He said one of the transactions would be the purchase of a major polymers unit of a publicly held company. "This is not the business Jon was referring to," Olsen said of the Eastman Chemical unit. A spokesman for Eastman Chemical, based in Kingsport, Tenn., could not be reached for comment. The PaineWebber report said Eastman Chemical did not comment on the speculation.
