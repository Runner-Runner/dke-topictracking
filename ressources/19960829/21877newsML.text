U.S. rail and truck cash soymeal basis offers were mostly steady on Thursday with light export demand noted, several cash brokers said. "Export-wise, we're seeing a little buying in the market in the last couple of days," a Kentucky broker said. Taiwan overnight bought 108,000 tonnes U.S. soybeans. USDA said Thursday the Philippines had purchased 76,000 tonnes U.S. soymeal in the week ended August 22. Several brokers noted domestic demand was steady but end-users were holding out for lower CBOT October futures prices. The September was trading at about a $8.50 premium. At 1048 CDT CBOT September soymeal futures were trading at $263.90 a ton and October was at $255.50. "A lot of people we talk to are sitting on the sidelines," a Tennessee broker said. "We're going to be on the October in a matter of three or four weeks so they're going to wait it out."
