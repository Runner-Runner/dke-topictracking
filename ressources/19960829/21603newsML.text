Excessive expansion in shipbuilding capacity remained a concern for the international shipping industry, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp said in a research report issued on Thursday. But the fundamental prospects were positive as the world economy gathered momentum and trade volumes rose, it said. Hongkong Bank noted the performance of the international shipping markets had remained uninspiring in the past 12 months. The improved dry-bulk freight rates which peaked in mid-1995 had not been sustained and the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange Index had fallen over 50 percent from the all-time high of 2,352 in May 1995 to the current 1,090. The number of orders for larger vessels suggested that freight rates would remain soft for the next 12 months, it said. The tanker market remained in the doldrums, especially for larger vessels. But with many ships reaching the end of their working lives and contracting at a low level, there were grounds for optimism, the report said. In the liner sector, major operators continued to place orders for increasingly larger and more efficient vessels, raising doubts whether greater containerized cargo movements would be able to absorb rising capacity, it said. But the report said the number of banks providing ship finance had increased dramatically and there was no shortage of funding for the industry, fuelling new buildings to some extent. Competition among banks was fierce and margins extremely fine in the current comparatively low interest rate environment, the report added. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843-6441
