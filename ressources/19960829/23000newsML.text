Britain's Ladbroke Group Plc said on Thursday that Hilton Hotels Corp (HHC) intended to take a five percent stake in Ladbroke after the two announced a deal to create a worldwide alliance aimed at reuniting the Hilton Hotel brand. Ladbroke said in a statement that the agreement included an opportunity for the two to buy stakes in each other, subject to rules on cross directorships. "HHC's current intention is to acquire a five percent stake in Ladbroke at the earliest opportunity after the signing of the agreements," Ladbroke said.   The famous Hilton hotel brand has been operated by Hilton Hotels Corp in the U.S. and by Ladbroke elsewhere in the world since the latter acquired Hilton International in 1987. It has long been Ladbroke's aim to reunite the brand. Under the terms of the deal the two Hilton arms will co-operate on sales and marketing loyalty programmes and hotel development from 1997. Ladbroke said the deal would immediately give HHC a significantly larger presence in the international hotel business as well as allowing Ladbroke to take part in HHC's growing gaming business in the United States.   The deal will be reinforced by the appointment of the heads of the two firms to each other's boards. HHC president and ceo Stephen Bollenbach will join Ladbroke's board and Ladbroke chief executive Peter George will join the HHC board. HHC and Ladbroke will form a jointly-owned company to market and develop the Hilton brand internationally, drawing upon the management of the two businesses.   The deal includes plans to extend HHC's guest loyalty programme to all Hilton hotels and allows the two firms to participate in each other's future hotel developments with a 20 percent profit participatipation in full-service hotel developments in exchange for a 20 percent contribution to any required capital investment.
