Brazil's real fell 0.05 percent to close at 1.0161 per dollar in the commercial foreign exchange market after the Central Bank caught traders by surprise with the way it lowered the mini-band, dealers said. The Central Bank set the new trading level between 1.016 and 1.021 per dollar through a second buy/sell auction late in the afternoon. The Central Bank first lowered the mini-band through a morning buy-sell tender to between 1.0155 and 1.0205 per dollar. The previous mini-band, set last Friday, was between 1.015 and 1.020 per greenback.   Traders said banks were expecting only a drop of 0.1 percent at the market's open but the Central Bank instead lowered the mini-band by 0.05 percent. The Central Bank's move fueled speculation throughout the session over possible new drops in the mini-band, which ended up taking place at the end of the day through a second buy/sell tender, they added. Dealers expect a traditional end-of-the-month fight between players holding short and long positions in the future markets on Friday. In the interbank floating rate market, the real ended steady at 1.0206 per dollar, after the Central Bank sold dollars at 1.0205 reaisi per greenback. In the illegal parallel market, the real rose 0.19 percent to close at 1.032 real per greenback due to an increase in dollar supply, traders said. -- Alexandre Caverni, Sao Paulo newsroom, 55-11-2324411
