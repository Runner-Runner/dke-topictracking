Portugal's Banco Finantia said there was no basis for an investigation ordered by the state prosecutor following allegations of insider trading during the bank's unsuccessful bid to buy Banco de Fomento & Exterior (BFE). "The bank believes there is no basis whatsoever for opening an investigation...against (it)," Finantia said in a statement. "The bank has always adopted rigorous legal and ethical standards and in the relevant cases, namely that of the privatisation of BFE, was aided by the legal opinions of reputable law professors," it said. Portugal's state prosecutor's office said earlier it had ordered an investigation into Finantia but refused to comment on the nature of the probe. The daily Diario Economico said an official at Portugal's Financial Markets Committee (CMVM) had reported Finantia for alleged insider trading. The paper said the investigation would focus on a purchase of one million BFE shares at 2,500 escudos which took place on July 18 after Finantia and two other banks had made bids for the state-controlled bank. The purchase was allegedly based on confidential information. The government announced last week that Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI) had won the bidding battle. It offered 2,615 escudos per share for 65 percent of BFE. The maximum penalty for insider trading in Portugal is a two-year prison sentence which cannot be suspended. -- Lisbon editorial +(351-1) 3538254
