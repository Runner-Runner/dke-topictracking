Portugal's state prosecutor's office said it had ordered an investigation into Banco Finantia following allegations of possible insider trading during its unsuccessful bid to buy Banco de Fomento & Exterior (BFE). The spokesman was confirming a report of the investigation in the daily Diario Economico newspaper but he refused to comment on the nature of the probe. "We confirm that the state prosecutor has opened an investigation into Finantia," he told Reuters. Diario Economico said an official at Portugal's Financial Markets Committee (CMVM) had reported Finantia for alleged insider trading. The CMVM and Finantia both declined to comment on the report. The paper said the investigation would focus on a purchase of one million BFE shares at 2,500 escudos which took place on July 18 after Finantia and two other banks had made bids for the state-controlled bank. The purchase was based on confidential information. The government announced last week that Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI) had won the bidding battle. It offered 2,615 escudos per share for 65 percent of BFE. The maximum penalty for insider trading in Portugal is a two-year prison sentence which cannot be suspended. -- Lisbon editorial +(351-1) 3538254
