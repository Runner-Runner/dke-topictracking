Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd said on Thursday it would launch two types of videodisc players in Japan on November 1. The players will be priced at 79,800 yen and 98,000 yen, and it aims to produce 30,000 players per month. A company spokesman said he believed the two players would be the first DVD players to go on sale anywhere.   Toshiba Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Pioneer Electronic Corp have not yet set dates for when they will begin selling DVD players, but are expected to do so by the end of this year. Sony Corp has said it is planning to start selling DVD players and software next spring.   Asked whether manufacturers and film makers in the United States had agreed on a copyguard system, a Matsushita official said, "We understand that we have reached a common understanding as far as DVD movie players are concerned." The official also said that 40 to 60 software titles will be available in Japan by November 1. Matsushita's film making affiliate, MCA Inc, will also cooperate in producing software, but he declined to comment on whether MCA software would be available by November 1. Matsushita said it expects 500,000 DVD players to be sold industry-wide in the first year of sales.   "We hope to acquire a market share as large as possible," the official said. In 2000, Matsushita expects the DVD industry to be a five trillion yen to seven trillion yen market, comprising hardware, software and related items. He said the firm had not decided on a sales schedule for the U.S. market, but hoped to be selling DVD players there by Christmas.
