Ashworth Inc said Thursday it expects sales for its fiscal fourth quarter ending October 31 to be relatively flat versus the year-ago $13.1 million. "Looking forward, we anticipate fourth quarter sales to be approximately the same as the 1995 fourth quarter," the company said in reporting third quarter results. For the third quarter, ended July 31, Ashworth earned $0.02 a share on sales of $17.9 million, versus $0.07 a share on sales of $20.4 million a year ago.   Ashworth said third quarter sales were off roughly 12 percent due to several factors. It cited less-than-expected reorders of apparel, a more conservative approach to inventory that led to an early sell-out of some clothing lines and its decision to discontinue its women's and children's clothing. Excluding the loss of sales from discontinuing the two clothing lines, third quarter revenues would have risen six percent over the year ago period. While sales and earnings were off, Ashworth said its cash position has improved with a positive cash flow of $4.2 million for the nine months ended July 31 versus a negative cash flow of $8.8 million at the same time last year. Ashworth said its inventory is down $3.0 million and its bank debt also is down $3.0 million since the first of the 1996.
