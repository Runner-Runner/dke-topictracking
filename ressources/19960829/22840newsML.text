Any eventual improvement in the cost of servicing state debt next year will not be included as a provision in the 1997 budget, a source at the Italian Treasury said on Thursday. The government is currently paying an average 8.2 percent on state debt against a target of 7.7 percent for the end of 1996. The Treasury's three year economic programme (DPEF) forecasts an average interest rate on debt of 7.0 percent for 1997. "The trend for interest rates is consistent with DPEF forecasts," a source at the Treasury Ministry said. He added that the government hoped the eventual approval of the 1997 budget, which has to be presented by the end of September and ratified by parliament by the end of December, would lead to another fall in rates. "But this would be considered a gift, something to be registered after the budget (and not in it)," he added. The Treasury is hopeful rates will fall rapidly given the recent slowdown in inflation. Two Italian newspapers on Thursday quoted Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as telling cabinet collegues that the recent cautious fall in bank rates was keeping debt servicing costs unnecessarily high and hurting budget accounts. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501
