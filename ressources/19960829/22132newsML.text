U.S. jet fuel prices rose firmed sharply again on Thursday, lifted by gains on NYMEX heating oil futures, industry sources said. Prices jumped by more than 1.50 cents a gallon as supply concerns agins sent buyers scrambling for contracts even though the peak demand season is still months away. But cash markets were still quiet and differentials were little changed. New York Harbor 54-grade jet fuel was talked at about 4.00/4.25 cents over September futures. U.S. Gulf 54-grade was offered at 1.50 cents over the print, they said. -- Franklin Paul, New York Energy Desk +1 212 859 1620
