Egypt's public offering of 30 percent or 2.25 million shares in state miller Central and West Delta Flour Mills has ended at least five times oversubscribed, the agent for the sale said on Thursday. Mohammed el-Sharnoubi of Banque Misr told Reuters after the two-day offer which opened on Wednesday that the state will probably increase the stake on offer by an extra 10 percent. "We have not received all bids to buy yet but I can tell you that demand was high," he said. "The holding company has said it will increase the number of shares on offer to meet demand and they'll certainly sell the whole 40 percent." The government, entrenched in an privatisation-led economic reform programme, has said it will not sell more than 40 percent in its milling firms because it regards them as strategic. The state had offered individual investors 750,000 shares -- priced at 40 pounds each -- which represent 10 percent of the firm's total 7.5 million shares. Mutual funds and investment institutions were allocated another 10 percent of the shares while another 10 percent is set aside for the milling firm's employees. The state said that all successful shareholders would get a minimum 4.1 pounds dividend for the financial year which ended June 30, 1996 on a forecast after-tax profits of 42.22 million. Profits for the previous financial year were 38.08 million. -- Miral Fahmy, Cairo newsroom  +202 578 3290/91
