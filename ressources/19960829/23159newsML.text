Hong Kong stocks ended weaker on Thursday, with a share placement from New World Development dulling the market's tone, analysts said. The Hang Seng index fell 51.28 points to 11,328.21. Turnover was HK$4.07 billion compared to HK$3.65 billion on Wednesday. "On the one hand the market lacks direction in the short term and also New World is down quite a lot because of a placement," said Ben Kwong, director of research at Dharmala Securities. Trading in New World was suspended during the afternoon. The stock was down HK$0.90 at HK$38.00 before the suspension.   Sources said the company was placing 70 million shares. The price is expected to be HK$37.10 per share, one placing source said. "Investors normally do not perceive it as good sign when blue chip companies place shares. They think the blue chip companies will make use of a short-term market peak for placements and also investors are worried about whether other companies will follow the same move," said Kwong. August Hang Seng futures, which expired on Thursday, ended 46 points higher at 11,396. September futures fell 47 points to 11,335.   Kwong said stocks are likely to remain confined to ranges on Friday. "I expect the market will consolidate and hopefully we will see a better performance in September," he said. Losses in the H-share index were limited by strong gains in Qingling Motors stock. The H-share index closed 0.69 point lower at 814.92. "The H-shares are holding up reasonably well. Part of it is because one or two big stocks are doing quite well," said Alan Hutcheson, director of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Qingling hit a year high at HK$3.15 after reporting interim profit of 183.01 million yuan compared to 29.65 million.   The stock ended the session up HK$0.15 at HK$3.05. Yizheng Chemical rose HK$0.06 to HK$1.81. Shares in First Pacific closed HK$0.05 higher at HK$12.85 and Henderson Investment fell HK$0.10 to HK$8.50.
