Unidentified attackers set fire to a foreigners' hostel in the southeastern German town of Schwarzenbach, and one resident was slightly injured, police in the town of Hof said on Thursday. The attackers poured inflammable liquid over two car tyres late on Wednesday and set them alight, setting fire to the home where about 60 asylum seekers live. Police put the damage to the hostel at around 100,000 marks ($68,000). Germany has experienced several arson attacks on foreigners since unification in 1990, among them a blaze started by four young right-wingers in the town of Solingen in 1993 in which five Turkish women and girls died. Last January 10 people died in a fire which appeared to have been started deliberately at a foreigners' hostel in Luebeck. Prosecutors have charged a young Lebanese resident, although a court ruled that suspicions were not strong enough to keep him in custody. ($1=1.4770 Mark)
