The Italian government would make cautious use of a golden share in state-controlled telecoms group Stet after the company is privatised, industry minister Pierluigi Bersani was quoted as saying on Thursday. In an interview with Milan daily Corriere della Sera, Bersani also reaffirmed the government's intention of forming a hard core of shareholders, dominated by Italians but with a strong foreign presence, who would control Stet. No single private shareholder would be allowed to have a dominant role within the hard core, Bersani said. He added that the government would stand firm by its commitment to keep Stet's two main offshoots -- fixed line company Telecom Italia and mobile phone group Telecom Italia Mobile -- under the same ownership. "As for the golden share, I would think (in terms of) sober and essential use," Bersani said. "We will form a hard core of shareholders, prevalently Italian but with a strong foreign presence, taking great care not to determine dominant positions," he said. Bersani said one of the aims of the privatisation was to allow new players to emerge on the Italian financial markets. "Our objective is to crowd the Italian financial market with new protagonists, which does not mean wanting to discriminate against the old protagonists," said Bersani. "But it would be really odd for the country to emerge from the cycle of privatisations with an unchanged landscape of financial power," said Bersani. Critics of the Stet sell-off, led by the hard left Communist Refoundation party, have said they fear the company will end up in the hands of private merchant bank Mediobanca and the close-knit network of industrial families which make up its client base.
