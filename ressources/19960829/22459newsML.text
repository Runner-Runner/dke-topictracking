Shares in RTZ Corp tumbled 15p to 961-1/2p after the mining concern released weaker-than-expected interim profits for one of its copper subsidiaries, traders said.   RTZ's Bougainville Copper Ltd unit said its pre-tax profits fell to 3.55 million stg in the first half of the year, down from 4.91 million stg in the year ago period. "RTZ's subsidiary results haven't been inspiring, to say the least," said one dealer. "People are nervous that (RTZ's) profits are going to be a lot weaker than even the lowest estimates given the (drop in) copper prices," he added. -- Debra Sherman, London newsroom +44 171 542 4026
