Turkey's parliament on Thursday agreed changes to laws which will effectively increase the powers of provincial governors in their fight against Kurdish rebels, the state-run Anatolian news agency said. The legal changes will enable governors to call for cross-border operations in pursuit of Kurdish guerrillas or to demand military support from other provinces if they judge their own forces to be insufficient. The changes were agreed in an extraordinary parliamentary session called to discuss the reform of emergency rule and other security-related measures. Emergency rule has been in force in 10 mainly-Kurdish provinces in Turkey's southeast since 1987 as part of Ankara's strategy to combat the rebel Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), which is fighting for independence or autonomy in the region. Over 20,000 people have died in the conflict. Parliamentary discussions continued on the reforms, which were originally called to consider bringing an end to emergency rule in some provinces.
