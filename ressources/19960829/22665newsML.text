Tapistron International Inc said Nasdaq will delete the company from the Nasdaq Stock Market effective on Thursday. The company said in a statement late on Wednesday the deletion was "a result of the company's non-compliance with the quantitative maintenance criteria for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market." Tapistron's common stock will continue to be publicly traded as a bulletin board stock, the statement said. The company filed for Chapter 11 reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June. -- New York newsroom, (212) 859-1610
