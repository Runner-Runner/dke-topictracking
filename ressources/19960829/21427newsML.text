Venezuela's privatization program, dealt a harsh blow by the cancellation of the Banco de Venezuela sale Wednesday, could be threatened by traditional political disputes, Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar acknowledged Thursday. "The Banco de Venezuela experience gives us much to think about," he told a news conference. "I hope it (the postponement of the sale) is not an expression of the power groups which have always been interested in the bank. And I hope that something similar does not occur with the privatization of other banks." Venezuela's top banks have traditionally been associated with different political parties which have used them to bankroll election campaigns and provide jobs for supporters. Accusations by leading opposition party Democratic Action (AD) last week that the $275 million sale price set for Banco de Venezuela was too low and that certain bidders had access to privileged information led to a judge ordering the suspension of the auction last Friday. The same judge reversed her decision Monday but the confusion had already undermined the confidence of potential bidders and unleashed a slinging match in the local press between AD and social Christian party, Copei. Matos acknowledged that the government's weak position in Congress made it more difficult to push through the economic reform program it started in April. "It would be much easier to do everything we want if we had a majority in Congress," he said. -- Omar Lugo, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
