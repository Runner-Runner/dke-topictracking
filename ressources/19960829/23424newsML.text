Irish-based shipping company Irish Continental Group Plc said on Thursday it was confident of a satisfactory outcome for the full year. Passenger travel between Britain and Ireland and freight volumes were firm although there was continuing weakness in sea traffic between continental Europe and Ireland, Irish Continental said in its results statement. It reported a reduced first-half pre-tax loss of 1.94 million punts versus 3.17 million in the same period last year.   "Overall, given our balanced range of activities and in the absence of material adverse events outside the group's control, the group is confident of a satisfactory outcome for the full year," Irish Continental said in a statement. Managing director Eamonn Rothwell said the improved results vindicated the company's introduction in mid-1995 of the first of two large multi-purpose ferries on the Irish Sea. "We look forward to the introduction of the larger of the two vessels in early 1997," he said in a statement.   Irish Continental said its improved results had been achieved in the face of increased competition on Irish Sea routes. It said its associated company Bell Lines had disappointing results, mainly due to a downturn in the environment in which Bell Lines operated. A cost reduction programme had been initiated to improve performance, Irish Continental said. -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 660 3377
