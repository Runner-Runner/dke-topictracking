Germany's Federal Labour Office expects a deficit of 11 to 12 billion marks this year, over seven billion more than the government had budgeted for, sources at the Office said. German Finance Minister Theo Waigel had originally allowed for a deficit of 4.3 billion marks this year at the labour office, which the federal government is obliged to cover. He has already acknowledged that the office would need more than this but has given no precise figure. The sluggish economy and rising unemployment have put paid to his original calculations and are behind Wednesday's admission from the finance ministry that the planned 60 billion mark federal public deficit could not be met this year. The office had already said in May that the deficit would be at least eight billion marks this year. -- Ashley Seager, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-2609750
