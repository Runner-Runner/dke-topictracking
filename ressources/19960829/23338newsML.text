Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the Japanese Ministry of Finance's (MOF) International Finance Bureau, will speak at a seminar in Washington on September 3, a MOF official said. Sakakibara is to deliver a speech at the opening of the seminar about "Development Thinking and Practice" to be held by the Inter-American Development Bank from September 3 to 5. The MOF official said Sakakibara was unlikely to specifically mention the foreign exchange markets, but currency operators in Tokyo will be monitoring his speech closely as a clue for direction on the dollar/yen rate.   Another MOF source said Sakakibara was likely to meet U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers in Washington. Sakakibara, dubbed "Mr Yen" by the financial markets, is widely seen as the key figure in pushing the dollar back up to above 100 yen from a postwar low of 79.75 yen hit on April 19, 1995.
