U.S. blue chips skidded to their biggest point loss since mid-July as a sharp upward revision in second-quarter GDP and a surge in July home sales reignited fears of a near-term Fed tightening. "We had two very strong economic reports. There are more worries in bond land. Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July," said David Shulman, Salomon Bros chief equity strategist. The Dow industrials lost 65 points or 1.13 percent to about 5648, the biggest drop since July 15's 161-point tumble.   The long bond slumped 23/32, boosting its yield above the key seven percent level to 7.04 percent -- the highest close since July 31. The Nasdaq Composite lost nine to 1145 and the S&P 500 was off seven to 657. Losers beat gainers 16-7 on quiet NYSE volume of about 323 million shares. Wall Street was further rattled by news that President Clinton's top political strategist, Dick Morris, resigned amid published allegations that he had engaged in an affair with a prostitute. He avoided comment in a published statement on his resignation.   Morris had been credited with helping Clinton reposition himself as a political centrist. Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton. Morris's departure raised fears Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term. "Clinton's right brain just fell off the truck," said one analyst, who requested anonymity. Bonds and stocks were initially rocked by news that second-quarter gross domestic product growth was revised to 4.8 percent from 4.2 percent. No change had been expected.   Later, the Commerce Department reported July single-family home sales rose 7.9 percent to an annual rate of 783,000 units. Economists had expected a 728,000 rate. The data "blew analysts out of the water and bonds collapsed," said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James. "Seven percent (for a long bond yield) creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities." "We could carry another 100 points lower. I'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday, so let's be careful," he said.   Wall Street next Friday faces the key August employment report. Interest-rate sensitive stocks were further pressured. Dow component J.P. Morgan lost 1-1/8 to 88, Wells Fargo was off 3-7/8 to 248-7/8, Cigna fell 2-7/8 to 114-7/8, and Merrill Lynch was off 3/8 to 62-1/4. PepsiCo was again the most heavily traded NYSE issue, off 1-3/8 to 28-5/8. Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its recommended list and downgraded the stock to moderate outperform. Goldman also trimmed 1996 and 1997 estimates.   IBM was again a pocket of strength, up 1/2 to 115-1/8. IBM surged 2-7/8 Wednesday after Salomon Brothers's upgrade. Red Lion surged 4-1/2 to 28-1/8 after news it is in preliminary merger talks with Doubletree, off 5/8 to 37-1/2. Baxter International rose 2-1/2 to 45-3/8 after news it will acquire Immuno International AG over three years in a deal worth about $715 million. Sierra Semiconductor surged 2-5/8 to 11-7/8 after news it planned to exit the highly competitive modem chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment.   Housecall Medical slumped 7-1/4 points or 50 percent to 7-1/4 after warning of a quarterly loss. Morgan Stanley, CS First Boston and Dean Witter cut ratings. Centocor lost 3-1/4 to 33-1/8. Oppenheimer raised questions about a key study in Centocor's leading drug ReoPro and called the stock "overvalued." Oppenheimer said the study for the blood-clot busting drug was unsuccessful in showing a six-month benefit for the drug. Centocor responded that the study was not designed to produce the longer-term effects.   Amtrol rallied 7-5/64 to 27-21/64 after an investor group agreed to buy it for $218.9 million or $28.25 a share. B.M.J. Financial surged 6-5/16 to 20-5/16 after Summit Bancorp agreed to buy B.M.J. in a tax-free exchange of stock. Summit lost 7/8 to 37-3/4. The Nasdaq Composite fell 8.85 to 1145.03. The S&P 500 index fell 7.41 to 657.40. (Figures official as of 1645 EDT/2045 GMT) -- Wall Street desk, 212 859 1721
