Individual equity options trading was spotty on Thursday, with most activity focused on issues linked to news events, traders said. PepsiCo Inc was the busiest option as investors reacted to a drop in the stock after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating and earnings estimates on the company. By afternoon, PepsiCo shares were off 1-1/4 at 28-3/4 on heavy consolidated turnover of 12.2 million shares. The PepsiCo October 35 call traded more than 7,800 contracts and was unchanged at 1/8. The September 30 call traded nearly 3,600 contracts. It fell 1/2 to 5/16.   "There's been a lot of paper in the October 35s and September 30s," a PepsiCo market maker said. "There was a large customer closing buy orders." He said other PepsiCo options activity was likely speculation linked to the underlying stock. Other active PepsiCo options included the October 32-1/2 calls and the October 27-1/2 puts, which traded 1,187 and 850 contracts, respectively.   A straddle in the Hilton Hotels Corp October 110 puts and calls was seen after the company signed a worldwide alliance with U.K.-based Ladbroke Group that will reunite the Hilton brand for the first time since 1964. Michael Schwartz, a managing director at Oppenheimer & Co, said the straddle indicated the investor anticipates some volatility in Hilton shares. One thousand of the Hilton October 110 puts and calls traded. The options expire in 51 days, on October 19.   An active option series not linked to news was Olympic Financial Ltd, which had several options on both the American Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange actives list. Traders said the activity was linked to one institution doing spreads on the options. The Olympic October 30 call traded 4,219 contracts on the CBOE, 2,234 contracts on the American Stock Exchange. The October 25 traded about 2,500 contracts on the CBOE, 1,500 on the American Stock Exchange.   Among puts on Olympic shares, the September 25s, October 20s and October 25s were most active. Olympic shares lost 7/8 to 25-1/8. --Gregory Crawford, Derivatives desk, (312) 408-8750 E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com
