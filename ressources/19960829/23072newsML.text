Wheat futures slipped slightly on the Sydney Futures Exchange on Thursday in line with Chicago's overnight fall. January 1997 and March 1997 both fell A$4.50, to A$188.00 and A$190.00 a tonne respectively, in a total of 14 trades. Option trading was light, with two calls on A$200 January at a A$5.00 premium. Andrew Szonyi of Perth Commodities and Futures Brokers Pty Ltd said he saw Australian wheat futures as cheap in relation to Chicago.   Chicago's US$4.55 a bushel would translate to an Australian equivalent of A$200-A$210 for the January contract, he said. "There's a little bit of value to be picked up if you bought here in comparison to where Chicago's trading at," he said. Szonyi believes the market is seeing the small picture, a good Australian wheat crop this year, instead of the bigger scene of world wheat scarcity for the next couple of years. "I would tend to look at buying around these (Australian) levels, it's around the lows now," he said. Szonyi said the Australian market should start to turn next month.
