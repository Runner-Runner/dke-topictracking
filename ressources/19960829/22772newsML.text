Norwegian seismic exploration company Petroleum Geo-Services on Thursday said it proposed to make a public offering of 4.6 million American Depositary Shares (ADS). The figure included 600,000 ADSs to cover over-allotment, and represented the same number of ordinary shares of the company, the company said in a press release. The company's ADSs are included on Nasdaq and its ordinary shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The company said it intended to file a registration statement relating to the securities to be offered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the near future. --Oslo newsroom +47 22 42 50 41
