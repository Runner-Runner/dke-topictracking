The state prosecutor's office said on Thursday it had ordered an investigation into Portugal's Banco Finantia after allegations of insider trading during its unsuccessful bid to buy Banco de Fomento & Exterior (BFE). "We confirm that the state prosecutor has opened an investigation into Finantia," a spokesman told Reuters. The spokesman was confirming a report in the daily Diario Economico newspaper of the investigation, although he declined to comment on the nature of the probe. Diario Economico said an official at Portugal's Financial Markets Committee (CMVM), the market watchdog, had reported Finantia for alleged insider trading over shares it is thought to have bought in BFE after lodging its takeover bid. At the time, BFE shares were surging on speculation of how high the bidding might go. The CMVM declined to comment on the report but Finantia said in a statement that it had done nothing that warranted an investigation. "The bank has always adopted rigorous legal and ethical standards and in the relevant cases, namely that of the privatisation of BFE, was aided by the legal opinions of reputable law professors," the bank said. According to Diario Economico, the investigation would focus on a purchase of one million BFE shares at 2,500 escudos ($16.51) which took place on July 18 after Finantia and two other banks had lodged their bids for BFE with the Finance Ministry. The government announced last week that Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI) had won the battle for BFE after a special selection jury ruled that its proposal was superior to that of Banco Finantia or the third candidate, Banco Nacional de Credito Imobiliario. BPI paid 2,615 escudos per share for the 65 percent of BFE controlled by the state. The maximum penalty for insider trading in Portugal is a two-year prison sentence which cannot be suspended.
