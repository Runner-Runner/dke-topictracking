Baxter International Inc. said Thursday it would acquire Immuno International AG of Austria for about $715 million, creating a global blood-products powerhouse. Baxter's purchase of Immuno, to be completed over three years, had the approval of both companies' boards but still needs approval from European Union and U.S. regulatory authorities, they said in a joint statement. Immuno, which is based in Vienna, is a leading manufacturer of biopharmaceutical products. Merging it with Baxter's biotechnology group will create a major provider of products and services for transfusion medicine, including biopharmaceuticals. The two companies had combined 1995 sales of $1.6 billion and employed 8,900 people. "This union fits into Baxter's overall strategy that aims to advance our global expansion and market penetration as well as to drive our technological innovation," Baxter President Vernon Loucks Jr said in a statement. Analysts said the accord would help both companies by melding their complementary strengths. "Immuno has good, high-quality products but the problem is ... the growth potential for products such as Immuno's was fairly limited," said Michael Sjostrom at Pictet & Cie in Geneva. "This makes sense for both companies." "In my eyes this was fairly well valued," said another pharmaceuticals analyst who asked not be named. He said Immuno could have had trouble finding a buyer because of its rare combination of blood plasma and vaccines businesses. Immuno, which has operations in 18 countries, will continue to operate as an independent company under executives of both Immuno and Baxter. Baxter, based in Deerfield, Ill., will offer 900 Swiss francs ($753.7) for each outstanding Immuno bearer share, once authorities clear the transaction. Immuno posted a pre-tax profit of 38.8 million Swiss francs ($32.5 million) in 1995, down from 43.5 million ($36.4 million) in 1994. Operating profit dipped to 61.3 million ($51.3 million) from 67.3 million ($56.4 million) on sales of 625.5 million ($523.8 million), down from 636.3 million ($532.9 million). Immuno board member Rolf Fuchs declined to give a forecast for 1996 earnings but said the company would announce first-half results within the next two weeks. He said the deal brought together companies that fit well together. "Probably the two companies are made for each other. We are very strong in eastern and western Europe, Baxter has a strong position in Asia and the United States," he told Reuters. "Our product lines are also complementary. This makes sense market-wise and geographically." He said blood-plasma products accounted for about 85 percent of sales and vaccines about 10 percent to 12 percent. The deal calls for Baxter to purchase from the controlling shareholders of Immuno a package of stock representing 54 percent of the voting interest and 37 percent of the capital. Baxter will pay 850 francs ($711.83) in cash for each of these bearer shares and 141.67 francs ($118.64) in cash for each registered share. An additional sum per share will be held back to provide for Immuno's contingent liabilities. Shortly after this transaction, Baxter will launch a cash tender for all publicly traded bearer shares, which account for 14 percent of the voting interest and 33 percent of the capital. Baxter will acquire all of the remaining shares of Immuno within three years after the first closing. The future share purchase price is fixed at 1,025 Swiss francs ($858.39) per bearer share and 170.83 Swiss francs ($143.06) per registered share in cash, with more funds held back against contingent liabilities.
