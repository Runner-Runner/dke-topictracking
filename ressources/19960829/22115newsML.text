President Clinton reiterated his determination  to balance the budget and criticized Republican rival Bob Dole's tax-cutting plan as risky for the economy. "We will balance the budget," Clinton said in a speech prepared for delivery later on Thursday. "(But) we will do it in a way that preserves Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment." The White House released early excerpts of Clinton's speech accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency.   The Medicare program provides health care benefits for the elderly. Medicaid does the same for the poor. Clinton criticized Dole's plan to slash taxes by $548 billion over six years, picturing it as a return to the failed supply-side policies of the 1980s. "Do we really want to make the same mistake again? To raise interest rates again? To stop economic growth again? To court recession again? To start piling up another mountain of debt?," Clinton asked. "Of course not." Dole has insisted that he can both balance the budget and cut taxes, although many economists are skeptical.   Clinton also used his speech to unveil a $3.43 billion initiative designed to move welfare recipients into work. "I propose to give businesses a tax credit for every person they hire off welfare, and keep employed, to offer private job placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job, if the worker stays in it," the president said. "And most important," he continued, "to help communities put welfare recipients to work repairing schools, fixing streets, making their neighborhoods shine again."
