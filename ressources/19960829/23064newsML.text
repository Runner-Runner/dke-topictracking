Barclay's de Zoete Wedd (BZW) said on Thursday it would not be closing its foreign exchange trading operations in Sydney despite recent reports to the contrary. "We have, I guess for want of a better term, continued to centralise trading in Singapore, but if anything on the sales side we've been growing," Martin Boyle, head of foreign exhange at BZW Sydney, told Reuters. "Yes, we're focusing more on the sales and customer side and derivatives, and less on the outright spot trading, and with technology these days, were doing more on the matching systems and things like that," he said.   Sydney, along with Tokyo and Hong Kong, had lost out a little bit to Singapore, which was Barclays main trading operation in the region, he said. One person on the spot side would leave next week, Boyle said, but he said that was more because the individual concerne did not want to re-locate to Singapore. "We basically have wound back here a little bit on the interbank side, but its focusing more on the customer side and its growing," Boyle said, adding that BZW were growing and in recruitment mode at the moment. "So as to closing down in Sydney, it's just not correct."   There had been reports in the specialised market press that BZW had closed its entire foreign exchange operations in Sydney and relocated to Singapore. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373 1800
