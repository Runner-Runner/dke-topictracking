Russian President Boris Yeltsin is working on documents at his holiday retreat and plans no meetings with officials on Thursday, his press secretary told RIA news agency. Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin was at his Rus residence, a hunting lodge used by former Soviet leaders some 100 km (60 miles) northeast of Moscow. Over the past two months Yeltsin, re-elected for a second term on July 3, has all but disappeared from the public eye, triggering speculation in the media and markets that he is ill or unable to control Russia's political situation. The Kremlin denies the rumours, saying he is merely tired after a tense election campaign.
