The European credit rating agency IBCA said on Thursday it assigned the Italian bank CREDIOP a short-term rating of A1 plus and a long-term rating of AA minus.   IBCA also assigned the bank an individual rating of A/B and a legal rating of 3, it said in a statement. The agency said the ratings reflected Crediop's excellent asset quality, high level of capitalisation and good profitability. Crediop, whose core activity is lending to Italian local authorities and state entities, is wholly owned by Istituto Bancario di Torino, the largest Italian banking group. Crediop is also active in advisory and consulting services and project financing, IBCA said. -- International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6320
