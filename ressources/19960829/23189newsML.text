Japan wants more time to look into the situation surrounding allegations by Cray Research Inc that NEC Corp was selling supercomputers in the United States at less than fair prices before deciding what steps to take, a senior Japanese trade official said on Thursday. "There are many things we have to look into...so give us more time. If it is an invisible trade barrier, we may have to consider further steps," Hisashi Hosokawa, vice trade minister for international trade affairs, told a news conference.   "Evidently the budget (for the supercomputer purchase) has been stopped...and not only Japanese companies but others will be inconvenienced," he said. U.S. supercomputer maker Cray filed a petition on July 29 with the Commerce Department alleging that NEC was selling supercomputers in the United States at less than fair prices. The U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research tentatively agreed on May 20 to buy four NEC supercomputer systems. But earlier this month the government-funded National Science Foundation, which is the primary funding agency, said it was withholding approval to buy these supercomputers until the dumping allegations were resolved.   "We need more time to look into the detailed aspects of this matter," Hosokawa said, adding that any decision to take the case to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for dispute settlement would require Japan to be "quite specific" on the reasons for doing so. He said, however, that he did not mean to imply that Japan would necessarily take the case to the WTO. "We are simply examining all the elements. Japan has already filed an opposition position paper on the issue with the U.S. government," he said.
