The European central bank (ECB) should be clear about its targets and prepared to explain blunders in order to win credibility, Dutch central bank president and possible ECB president Wim Duisenberg said. "Its strategy should be transparent. The ECB should use clear policy goals on the basis of which the public and financial markets can come to a verdict," he said in a speech on Thursday that was made available in advance. "Secondly, its strategy should be such that it can explain its moves. Blunders should be explained...Timely and accurate information to the public and markets is essential," he said. Duisenberg, who will take over as head of the European Monetary Institute in July 1997 and probably its successor, The European Central Bank, also said the European central bank's main goal of price stability could be achieved by either money supply targets or direct inflation targeting. Both strategies had their merits and did not exclude other factors. "In reality there is a certain similarity between the two strategies," he told a conference in Alpbach, Austria. Which one of the two the ECB would choose depended on the possibilities for transparency and explanation, he said. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
