President Eduardo Frei on Thursday commuted to life in prison the death sentence of a man convicted of raping and murdering a nine-year-old boy. "I don't believe that to defend life and punish those who kill the state must also kill," Frei said in a brief, emotional speech, explaining why he was commuting the sentence of Cupertino Andaur. "The consequences of his heinous actions will accompany him for the rest of his life in prison." The execution would have been Chile's first in 11 years. Frei's decision followed weeks of controversy on the impending execution and the death penalty, which has not been applied in Chile since 1985 when two rogue policemen were executed for a string of rapes and murders. Politicians, church leaders, judges and human rights groups offered conflicting advice to Frei on whether to allow the execution. Polls showed public opinion evenly split. Frei had given no clear sign which way he would go but said at one point he would consider reprieves on a "case-by-case basis" -- implying he thought there were some cases where execution was justified. Andaur had been due to be executed by firing squad in the next few weeks for raping and murdering Victor Zamorano Jones in the boy's bedroom after breaking into his family's Santiago home.
