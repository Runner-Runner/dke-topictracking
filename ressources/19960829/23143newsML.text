Visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda was dogged for the second day on Thursday by protests against Japan's claim to islands in the East China Sea. One group, which staged an all-night sit-down protest outside Ikeda's hotel, burnt a Japanese flag and a portrait of Ikeda outside Tokyo's consulate in the British colony after finding he had foiled them by leaving the hotel by a side door. It was the second day Ikeda had been hounded. On Wednesday several hundred demonstrators attempted to assail him with demands for compensation for World War Two atrocities committed when Japanese forces occupied Hong Kong. Thursday's protesters had unfurled banners with sharply worded messages to lobby the minister when he came out of the hotel, but in vain. The protesters condemned Japan's claim to sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands -- known as the Senkakus in Japanese -- which they said were Chinese territory. The disputed islands are claimed by China, Taiwan and Japan. A row broke out between China and Japan last month when Japanese right-wingers built a lighthouse on one. Chanting slogans and waving placards, demonstrators marched to the consulate where the minister was expected. "Get off Diaoyu Island, Japanese," they shouted. "Protect the dignity of the Chinese." They pinned an upside-down photograph of the minister on the consulate's door. "It'll only take 10 seconds to receive the petition letter. But he doesn't have the guts or courtesy to do so," protest spokesman Ho Chun-yan told reporters. A Japanese foreign ministry spokesman accompanying Ikeda reiterated Tokyo's position, telling reporters the islands had always been an "an inseparable part of Japan". The protesters were from various pressure groups. Ikeda ends his visit later on Thursday.
