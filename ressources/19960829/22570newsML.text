Intermedya will waive 50 billion lira of preemptive rights to offer them to the public while raising its capital to 220 billion lira from the existing 170 billion, it said in a newsletter. The company's biggest shareholder will also sell the five billion lira stake it holds in the company, raising the total amount offered to 55 billion lira. A consortium led by Ekinciler Yatirim ve Menkul Degerler will manage the offer. Other consortium members are Global Menkul Degerler, Sumerbank and Evgin Menkul Degerler A.S.. Turkish Vakifbank will act as intermediary in the sales. Intermedya Yayincilik owns the daily financial newspaper Global and the monthly financial magazine Macro Economy. The company also publishes four weekly financial magazines, called Intermedya Ekonomi, Paratuyo, Borsamatik and Borsanaliz. The company says the four magazines hold a total 35 percent market share in the weekly financial magazines market. -- Istanbul Newsroom, +90-212-275 0875 SA
