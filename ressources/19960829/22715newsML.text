Swedish forest products group SCA said on Thursday that profits for the second half of 1996 would be at best the same as the first half. "In the best case it will be the same as the first half," Chairman Sverker Martin-Lof told a news conference.   Martin-Lof said the third quarter would be the worst this year for SCA, a fact that would hit profits in the second half of the year. "We'd need a fairly substantial upturn in the fourth quarter to offset the very week third," Martin-Lof said. On the upside, a gradual improvement on the pulp market would continue, although there was some risk of a backlash. "You can't rule out a recoil but there's not that much to suggest it," he said, adding he expected customer pulp stocks to increase in the traditionally weak month of August. Martin-Lof said there would not be any clear indication as to which way the pulp market was going until next month. "We'll have to wait and see what demand looks like in September," he said. -- Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1006
