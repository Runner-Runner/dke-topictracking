The U.S. municipal bond market was unchanged Thursday, remained stuck in its late August funk with little action expected until after Monday's Labor Day holiday. In the meantime, Cleveland officials Thursday morning took another whack at selling an $81.7 million parking bond issue, after an attempt by Grigsby Brandford & Co to price the deal last week fell apart. Smith Barney Inc took over the account and priced the deal Thursday at a top yield of 5.85 percent in 2022.   That yield was 10 basis points higher than the yield Grigsby attempted on the same maturity last week. But Cleveland officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on whether the city lost money by waiting an extra week. Other key players, including Grigsby, also did not comment on what went wrong. The muni cash market remained mostly flat while Treasuries dropped Thursday morning after strong economic data.   The Commerce Department said second quarter gross domestic product was revised higher to a 4.8 percent annualized rate. Economists expected an unchanged reading of 4.2 percent. The Treasury long bond was down 9/32 at 96-26/32 to yield 7.01 percent. Debt futures were mixed, with the September municipal contract up 2/32 at 114-29/32 and the September T-bond contract down 7/32 at 108-18/32. The MOB spread was 203, compared to 194 at the close Wednesday. In the muni secondary, bids on Cook County, Ill., FGIC 5-7/8s of 2022 were down 1/4 at 98-3/4. --Steven Dickson, 212-859-1652
