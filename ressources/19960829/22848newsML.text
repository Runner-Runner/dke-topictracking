Shares in Italian information and technology group Olivetti rose strongly reflecting good progress made at its 41.3 percent owned mobile phone group Omnitel and a overnight rise in U.S. high-tech stocks, dealers said. The shares were also helped by market talk that a meeting in London this week between Olivetti and institutional shareholders had discussed the departure of chairman Carlo De Benedetti, but a spokeswoman at Olivetti said there was nothing new to report. Olivetti shares rose to an early day's high of 807 lire before settling up 1.79 percent at 797 lire at 1020 GMT, with trading volume at a light 5.6 million shares. Dealers said that Omnitel had made very good progress gaining 300,000 subscribers by the end of June after it launched its mobile phone service in December 1995, and there was talk that it was pushing up its projected subscriber for end-1996. They added that Olivetti shares had suffered in the last few days and the rise today was part of the recovery of these losses. Also helping the shares was the overnight rise in U.S. high-tech stocks such as IBM on Wall Street. The Olivetti spokeswoman stressed that nothing had changed at the top of Olivetti since early July when De Benedetti gave up his role as joint managing director to become just chairman in charge of strategic issues when Francesco Caoi took over as sole managing director in charge of day-to-day management. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129502
