Questar Corp said it had signed a letter of intent to buy about 37 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) of gas and oil reserves in the Alberta, Canada, region. The company said in a statement late on Wednesday it would also create a Canadian affiliate to manage and develop the properties. R.D. Cash, Questar chairman, president and chief executive, said the reserves would be bought from a privately held Canadian company for about $51 million. The company was not named and the deal is expected to close on Friday.   The purchase price has been adjusted to reflect revenues generated by the properties prior to the closing. The new Questar affiliate, Celsius Energy Resources Ltd, will be headquartered in Calgary. Dale W. Bossert, a Canadian and former vice president of exploration for Union Pacific Resources Group Inc, will be general manager. The 37 Bcfe reflects net proved reserves, in accordance with U.S. reporting requirements. They consist of 19.6 billion cubic feet of gas and 2.9 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids. The purchase will generate immediate earnings and cash flow for Questar, the statement said. Net daily production for the first half of 1996 averaged eight million cubic feet of gas and 900 barrels of oil and natural gas fluids. -- New York newsroom, (212) 859-1610
