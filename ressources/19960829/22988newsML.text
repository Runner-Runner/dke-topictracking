Shares in engineering and motor components group T&N Plc fell 3-1/2 pence to 140-1/2 by 0814 GMT Thursday amid renewed fears about its exposure to asbestos-related law suits. Worries that the company could face an additional 50 million stg of charges if a key U.S. damages system for asbestos fails overshadowed T&N's first-half results, which were broadly in line with expectations. News of the possible additional costs had sent the shares down to a low of 132-1/2 pence in early dealing.   One market-maker in the stock said: "Basically the results were okay." But he cited worries that the company's liabilities for the U.S. settlement may be double previous expectations. Another dealer who asked not to be named said he expects T&N shares "will be weak for some time", adding he is recommending investors sell the stock. The group's shares were trading close to what many analysts had hoped would prove to be a floor level of 140 pence in midmorning.   T&N on Thursday announced that first-half pretax profit slipped to 58.1 million stg from 73.2 million a year before, after warning that destocking and disposal costs had hit its performance. Market-makers said the group's failure to lift its dividend, although widely expected, and a downbeat outlook for the second half compounded the gloom. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
