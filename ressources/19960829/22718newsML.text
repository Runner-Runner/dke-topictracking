The European Union's sugar management committee concluded its Wednesday meeting by fixing end-of-month refunds, an EU source said on Thursday. "It was usual business," the source said. "The first bit of business was the export refund tender for white sugar." The maximum amount of refunds was set at 43.521 Ecu/100 kg. "That will release a total of 16,000 tonnes of white sugar," the source said. Periodic refunds were set for white sugar at 40.52 Ecu/100 kg, for raw sugar at 37.07 Ecu/100 kg, for syrup at 40.52 Ecu/100 kg and for inulin syrup at 76.99 Ecu/100 kg. Refunds for sugar in non-annex II goods such as biscuits, chocolate and other food items not covered by the Common Agricultural Policy were also set. For white sugar, non pre-fixed refunds were 40.518 Ecu/100 kg. Pre-fixed refunds were 37.518 Ecu/100 kg. For raw sugar, non pre-fixed refunds were 37.28 Ecu/100 kg. Pre-fixed refunds were 34.52 Ecu/tonne. In other business, the committee reviewed import duties on cane and beet molasses. "The import duty on beet molassases remains suspended," the source said. The CIF price established by the Commission was 11.10 Ecu/100 kg. "A small duty is being set on cane molasses -- 0.11 Ecu/100 kg," the source said. It was done on the basis of a CIF price of 8.10 Ecu/100 kg."
