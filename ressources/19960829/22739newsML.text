The European Union received three bids for a total of 56,000 tonnes of wheat exports with refunds at Thursday's main grain tender, European grain sources said. One bid for 50,000 tonnes, via France, was for a refund of 7.27 Ecus per tonne. In Germany, traders bid for two parcels of 3,000 tonnes of wheat each with refunds of 1.5 and 2.5 Ecus. Traders also sought wheat refunds in a special tender for ACP states. These were for 20,000 tonnes at 3.9 Ecus, 3,000 tonnes at 4.98 Ecus and 8,000 at 12.27 Ecus. The bids are for wheat from the open market. Sources said earlier there would be pressure on the EU to award subsidies.   Traders also bid for wheat exports with the now customary export taxes. These ranged across the EU between 0.06 Ecus per tonne and 1.28 Ecus per tonne, grain sources said. The total volume of wheat sought at the main export tender was 281,800 tonnes. In a special tender for ACP countries -- around 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific nations tied to the EU through the Lome preferential trade accords  -- traders sharply increased the bidding for subsidies by bidding for 8,000 tonnes at a refund of 12.27 Ecus per tonne.   They also bid for 3,000 tonnes at a refund of 4.98 Ecus and 20,000 tonnes at a refund of 3.90 Ecus, grain sources said. For barley, traders bid for 83,000 tonnes with refunds between 13.69 Ecus per tonne and 25.98 Ecus per tonne. Via France, the barley bids included 15,000 tonnes at 25 Ecus and 20,000 and 25.98 Ecus. Via Spain they were for 15,000 tonnes at 19.99 Ecus. The rest of the bids were posted through Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Rye bids totalled 39,000 tonnes and were for refunds of 27.49 to 28.50 Ecus per tonne, sources said.   Bids for oats from the free market covered 54,500 tonnes at refunds of 23.9 to 31.95 Ecus per tonne. For intervention grain, seen likely to help cover big barley sales to Saudi Arabia, traders sought a net quantity of 268,792 tonnes at prices between 103.53 Ecus and 110.45 Ecus per tonne. They also sought 86,247 tonnes of rye between 92.07 and 104.04 Ecus, sources said. All intervention bids are for stores in Germany. German intervention bids are adjusted for double counting. -- Paris newsroom +331 4221 5146
