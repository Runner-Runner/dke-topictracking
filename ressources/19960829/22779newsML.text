German airline Eurowings Luftverkehrs AG said it has signed a code-share deal with Newcastle-based British regional carrier Gill Airways. Eurowings said in a statement the British airline will take over its five days a week Duesseldorf-Newcastle route with effect from September 1, flying under joint Eurowings and Gill Airways flight codes. Gill Airways will use an ATR-72 aircraft on the Monday-Friday service, which will be its first Germany destination, the statement added. Eurowings marketing director Ulrich Sigman said in the statement the airline hopes for more business from Britain through Newcastle-based Gill Airways. Eurowings spokeswoman Susanne Schmid told Reuters: "We have flown the route for two years. It developed well but not satisfactorily." The airline gave up a Sunday flight in April to use the Duesseldorf slot for a flight to Amsterdam in co-operation with partner airline KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV D, she explained. Eurowings will use the attractive 10.40 slot at Duesseldorf for its new Katowice service, which starts on September 2, Schmid said. "The average yield on the Newcastle route is not comparable with Poland," she noted. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44-171-542-7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017
