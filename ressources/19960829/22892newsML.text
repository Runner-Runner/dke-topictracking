Jardine Fleming Holdings said it accepted the criticisms of procedures at its JFIM unit made by Hong Kong and UK regulatory bodies and was making voluntary payments to clients who had been disadvantaged by its failings. It said in a statement that the payments, to be made to three clients, would total $19.3 million.   The investigation was launched after Jardine Fleming Asset Management, a sister company of Jardine Fleming Investment Management, reported what Fleming called "certain systems deficiencies" in 1995. Fleming said the SFC had now concluded that there were weaknesses in JFIM's dealing and compliance procedures under which clients could be disadvantaged.   Actual disadvantage was considered to have occurred in three portfolios managed by a single former fund manager. Two of the clients affected were publicly-held funds, the JF Pacific Securities Trust and the FFF-Fleming Pacific Fund, while the third was referred to as an overseas institutional client. Payments are being made from JFIM's resources and are not expected to affect Jardine Fleming's first-half 1996 profits. Earlier, the UK's Imro said it had fined JFAM and three other companies in the Robert Fleming group 700,000 stg and ended the registration of JFAM's former chief executive Robert Thomas. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 7717
