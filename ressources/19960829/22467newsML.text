Shares in Cadbury Schweppes rose 8p to 514-1/2p on Thursday as broker ABN AMRO Hoare Govett repeated its "buy" recommendation on the stock, market sources said. "It's nothing dramatic, they've just re-iterated their buy stance ahead of the figures and feel there are opportunities for organic growth in confectionery," said one. Hoare Govett analysts were not immediately available for comment. Cadbury is due to report first-half results on September 4. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8712
