U.S. West Coast product prices turned narrowly mixed late on Wednesday, with subdued activity on the back of a strong futures market. NYMEX September gasoline ended 1.09 cents over Tuesday's close. October crude futures ended the day 15 cents higher at $21.69, aided by fears that a new storm would disrupt supply. "It's the conspicuous strength in NYMEX crude," that helped lift some product prices, one broker said. Prices also firmed on smaller inventories, with the American Petroleum Institute reporting West Coast gasoline stocks fell 845,000 barrels last week, to 27.7 million barrels.   Los Angeles regular unleaded was seen between 66.50 and 67.50 cents, off a half cent from earlier trading on weak interest. But premium traded at a 7.50 cent premium, as more buyers came in on reports of a few shut refinery units. Mobil's fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) near Los Angeles came off line recently, according to market sources. Unocal Corp in Northern California continued to resume normal production levels after shutting a crude unit for repairs.   And Cheveron was rumoured to begin shutting a unit in early September at its Los Angeles refinery. Bids for CARB gasoline in Los Angeles rose a half cent in late trading to 69.50 cents. Los Angeles low sulphur diesel was 69/70 cents, coming off 0.50 cent from morning levels. The jet fuel market in L.A. was called slightly higher by traders, up one cent to 72/73 cents. One trader speculated that demand had risen from firefighting helicopters in California. -- David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles bureau +1 213 380 2014
