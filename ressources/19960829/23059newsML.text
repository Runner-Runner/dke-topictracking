Optus Vision, the pay TV unit of telecommunications group Optus Communications Pty Ltd, said on Thursday it had launched "The Education Channel" on its network. Optus Vision said the channel was dedicated to schools and tertiary education institutions in the state of Victoria and part of its A$60 million commitment to education. Optus Communications owns 46.5 percent of Optus Vision as does Continental CableVision Inc, which is currently merging with U.S. West. Seven Network Ltd and Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd own the remainder.   On Wednesday, Optus Communications said its share of losses from Optus Vision was A$74.0 million. Optus said its direct investment in Optus Vision was A$372 million at June 30. This was more than half of the A$605 million it has committed to invest in Optus Vision by June 1997. Optus Communications plans a public float of its shares later this year. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
