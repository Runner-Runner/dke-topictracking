Sweden's Riksbank (central bank) ended its board meeting on Thursday without announcing any changes to its deposit, lending or repo rates. The repo rate, which is the central element of the Riksbanken's three-tier interest rate corridor, was cut by 15 basis points on Tuesday to 5.25 percent in a move widely anticipated by the market. The deposit and lending rates are set at 4.75 percent and 6.25 percent respectively. -- Stockholm newsroom, +46-8-700 1006
