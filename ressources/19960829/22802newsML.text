Two leading Austrian insurance firms have moved a step closer to a long-discussed cooperation, Vienna daily Der Standard reported on Thursday. Austria's second largest insurance company Verischerungsanstalt der Oesterreichische Bundeslaender Versicherung AG and its leading health insurer Austria-Collegialitaet Oesterreichische Versicherung AG have been discussing an alliance for several months. On Thursday, Herbert Schimetschek, chief executive of Austria-Collegialitaet, was quoted as saying the only obstacle to setting up a joint holding company was agreement on the valuation of the two firms. He was speaking during a trip to Finland. Bundeslaender was guarded in its response to the report. "I cannot comment on the details but by the end of the year we would like to achieve some clarity," a spokesman told Reuters. Collegialitaet was not immediately available for comment. Bundeslaender chief executive Walter Petrak has said a cooperation with Collegialitaet could bring synergy effects and millions of schillings in savings. He has pinpointed data processing as a possible cooperation area. Der Standard reported the most likely outcome of the talks was a joint holding company, in which Bundeslaender would take a 60 percent stake and Collegialitaet 40 percent. Bundeslaender, which is majority owned by the Raiffeisen group, has a 9.9 percent share of the Austrian insurance market and last year reported a premium income of 20 billion schillings. Austria Collegialitaet had a premium income of seven billion schillings last year. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254
