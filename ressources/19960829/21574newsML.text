China has expanded its programme to make state enterprises more competitive by creating large holding companies, officials said on Thursday. They said the trial project would be expanded to 100 major companies from 57 initially. "China's reform of enterprise groups is aimed at developing big conglomerates on the basis of a modern enterprise system," an official of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring told Reuters. China had earlier chosen 57 large enterprise groups in key industries for restructuring, including state-owned oil trader Sinochem, First Automobile Group Corp and Baotou Iron and Steel Co, he said. "We need to streamline relations between parent companies and subsidiaries while setting up a modern enterprise system in each company," the official said. As part of China's efforts to invigorate the state sector, the government has selected more profitable firms as potential candidates for the creation of large holding companies. Beijing hopes these bigger companies will be better able to compete in international markets. The groups would be allowed to set up subsidiaries or merge with other firms, the official said. China has extended special financial support to large and profitable state companies while leaving many of the less successful firms to fend for themselves in the marketplace. Around 40 percent of China's state enterprises are losing money, according to official figures. Total losses of state-owned industrial companies covered in the central government budget rose 55.6 percent year-on-year to 35.94 billion yuan ($4.33 billion) in the first half of 1996.
