Australian Finance Minister John Fahey committed the government on Thursday to further measures to retain the budget surplus if the Senate kills some of those announced in the budget. This contrasts with Treasurer Peter Costello's repeated refusal to discuss what might happen next. The issue is the remainder of the the A$8 billion in savings that the government has promised for the 1997/98 budget year. The August 20 budget has detailed A$7.2 billion in 1997/98 cuts, but that leaves A$800 million owing plus whatever the Senate removes. Fahey almost said today that the government will get its underlying surplus (that is, without asset sales) come what may. Here's the quote: "We have of course a strategy to reduce that deficit and get back into balance by 1998/99 -- a small (positive) balance of A$900 million. "And if we do lose some in the Senate then I guess we are going to have to go back to the drawing board because we are very, very determined to ensure that again in this period of economic growth that we get back into balance." This strongly suggests that the government will top up its A$7.2 billion if the Senate takes any away. But he still says nothing about the A$800 million needed to turn A$7.2 billion into A$8 billion. Heightening the concern, one notices from Treasury's forward estimates that the whole A$8 billion is not needed to produce the surplus. Worse, some private sector economists, thinking Treasury is a bit pessimistic on the budget, expect a bigger surplus in 1998/99 or even a surplus in 1997/98. If that sort of thinking started to sink into the government's mind, there would be very little incentive to come up with the rest of the A$8 billion. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
