Enerco NZ Ltd said on Thursday it had exercised an option to take a five percent equity stake in the 110 megawatt combined cycle Southdown power station near Auckland.   The sum was undisclosed. The project is a joint venture formed between TransAlta Energy and Mercury Energy. The project is significantly larger than co-generation plants Enerco has successfully promoted elsewhere, and Enerco's investment demonstrated its commitment to participate in energy efficient projects, Enerco said. "We anticipate the Southdown power station will provide us with a favourable return on our investment," it said.   Enerco is also directly involved in the gas supply to the project under contracts signed in 1994. Enerco anticipates gas will start to flow to Southdown toward the end of the year. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
