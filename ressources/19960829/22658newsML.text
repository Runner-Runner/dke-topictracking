Frontier Natural Gas Corp said it had entered into a joint exploration agreement for a Louisiana site with Fina Oil and Chemical Co, a unit of FINA Inc, and other parties. The company said in a statement late on Wednesday that they would acquire and use 3-D seismic and other joint data to explore for gas and oil in a contract area of more than 20 square miles in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. Included within the contract area is Frontier's Starboard Project. The company said the agreement preserved 100 percent of Frontier's interest in proven undeveloped reserves while expanding its potential exploratory drilling opportunities in terms of number of potential wells and net exploratory reserve potential. Financial terms were not released. -- New York newsroom, (212) 859-1610
