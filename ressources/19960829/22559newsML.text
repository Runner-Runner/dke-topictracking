Cyprus-based bank rating agency Capital Intelligence said it downgraded the long-term rating of Saudi Cairo Bank (SCB) to BBB-minus from BBB because of the bank's very high level of non-performing loans, unsatisfactory provisioning level and a lack of a diversified funding base. But the agency confirmed the bank's short-term rating at A-2 and said there is a stable outlook for the next 12 months. SCB is Saudi Arabia's eighth-largest bank, with a 5.5 percent market share, the agency said. The bank's capital is owned 55 percent by private Saudi interests, 25 percent by the state-controlled Public Investment Fund and 20 percent by the Cairo-based Banque du Caire. Recently United Saudi Commercial Bank's chairman, Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, bought 33.4 percent of SCB's capital. "A merger between SCB and United Saudi is the most likely scenario over the medium term and this prospect is viewed as positive as the two banks' profiles complement each other in many respects," the agency said.
