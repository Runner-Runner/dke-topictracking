Improved oil recovery at Norwegian fields could free up more than three billion barrels of oil, Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap ASA's (Statoil) Ole Svein Krakstad, chairman of the FORCE group of oil companies active offshore Norway, said on Thursday. But much of this potential could be lost if oil companies do not act quickly. "It is time critical. If no action is taken in the next five years at least half of these potential barrels will be lost," he told reporters at the 1996 Offshore Northern Seas conference. The FORCE group of 18 companies was set up last year to explore ways of increasing oil production at existing fields. With most opportunities for significant cost cutting in the North Sea oil industry now exhausted, producers are turning their attention to adding value by boosting revenue. "The continued drive of (cost-cutting) programmes such as NORSOK and CRINE are important, but now it is time for increasing revenues," Krakstad said. Improved oil recovery (IOR) will be more significant in stemming the decline in oil production offshore Norway than exploration activities, he said. "Three billion barrels we are sure about, but it could be even higher." The most important IOR technologies on the Norwegian Continetal Shelf are 4D seismic and gas reinjection. "We are lucky we have a surplus of gas and we should try and use it to produce more oil," Krakstad said. -- Rosalind Russell
