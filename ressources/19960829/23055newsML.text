Asia Pacific energy ministers, ending two days of talks in Sydney, said on Thursday forecast growth in energy supply in the region will place considerable pressure on the environment. The ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum said they had agreed that it was essential to apply economically sound measures to minimise adverse environment impacts in the region. The ministers agreed "to integrate environmental considerations into the planning and evaluation processes for energy infrastructure projects."   Over the next 15 years, APEC expected electricity demands in the region to increase by 50 to 80 percent. It said about US$1.6 trillion in investment capital would be required to establish a power infrastructure to underpin the region's economic growth. APEC estimated that its 18 member economies consume about half the world's energy. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.   Speaking to reporters, Australian Federal Minister for Resources and Energy Warwick Parer said the group had accepted that no government within APEC had the economic strength to provide the funds needed to meet future energy demands to 2010. The ministers also agreed to report to APEC leaders at the next meeting in the Philippines in November. Other points he made to the APEC leaders included the need for reform to mobilise business investment in energy. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
