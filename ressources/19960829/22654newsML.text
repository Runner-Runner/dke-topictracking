Air Express International (AEI) said it has signed a contract worth $6 million to manage Vishay Intertechnology Inc's international air freight traffic. The duration of the contract was not revealed. AEI said in a statement that the all-inclusive, door-to-door package also includes customs brokerage services. AEI said the contract is structured to reduce Vishay's air freight bill by $1.1 million per year by setting rates for each individual lane segment, or city pair, rather than on a network basis. Vishay is the largest US producer of "passive" electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors and inductors used widely in computers and most other electronic products. The company's major markets are in the U.S. and Europe. AEI's contract covers transportation between the U.S., European and Middle Eastern plants of Vishay and customers around the world. -Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
