After walking away last week from talks to buy Castle Rock Entertainment from Time Warner Inc -Turner Broadcasting System Inc, Sony Corp's Sony Pictures Entertainment is once more back in the hunt, Daily Variety reported on Thursday. Last week the studio abandoned plans to pursue the Turner film company after a partnership headed by Seagram Co's MCA Universal offered a substantial bid. Insiders said Sony was unwilling to match the offer. But early this week, Sony returned to the table with a new plan.
