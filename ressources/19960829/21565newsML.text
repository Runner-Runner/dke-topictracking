Japanese camera and office equipment maker Canon Inc. said Thursday that its group profits soared almost 90 percent in the first six months of the current business year, and predicted the trend would continue. Canon posted group net profit of 40.29 billion yen ($373 million) in the six months to June 30, up 89.2 percent from the same period a year ago. It expects 1996 full-year group net profits of 80 billion yen ($740 million) against actual group net profits of 55.04 billion yen ($509 million) in 1995. The half-year profit jump was due to increased sales, efficient manufacturing and various restructuring steps, Canon said in a statement. "In the half-year period that just ended, we expanded multimedia business, including that of digital cameras, and strengthened computer peripherals" such as printers, Canon said. "We decisively made comprehensive cost-cutting efforts. We tried to hedge foreign exchange risks and made other efforts to improve our financial health," the company said. Despite its positive earnings forecast for the full year, Canon was not overly optimistic about its business environment in the second half of 1996. "We see uncertainties over the economies in Japan and abroad and also over foreign exchange rates. We also expect that competition to become severe as well," it said.
