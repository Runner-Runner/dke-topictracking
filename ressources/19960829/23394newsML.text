Immuno International AG's bearer shares rose slightly on news Baxter International Inc planned to acquire the blood-products and vaccines company in a deal worth around 850 million Swiss francs. Bearers were bid at 885 francs in early trade, off a high of 889 but above the close at 883, in brisk business. The companies said Baxter planned to offer 900 francs per bearer share in a tender to be launched within three years. "With yesterday's price of 883 francs, this was not especially generous," one dealer said, adding expectations for a big rise could fade if a rival offer does not emerge. -- Zurich newsroom +41 1 631 7340
