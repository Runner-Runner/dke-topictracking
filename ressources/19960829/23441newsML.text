Chairman of the social security board Jean-Marie Spaeth said he expected a deficit this year of 50 billion to 55 billion francs and added that the target of a 1997 deficit of 25 billion would be difficult. Spaeth told the Liberation newspaper: "The deficit will be around 50 to 55 billion francs and 35 billion just for the health insurance. It's considerable," he said.   The government had originally ordered the social security system to reduce its 1996 deficit to 17 billion francs and make a surplus of 12 billion in 1997. "Our system of social protection cannot continue like this or its will explode in our faces. We have to take this deficit serious but at the same time we should not say that all is damned, that there is no solution," said Spaeth. He is the national secretary of the CFDT union and took the presidency of the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM) this year, a post which had previously been held by the Force Ouvriere union. "The problem is to get as soon as possible an equilibrium, excluding the debts of the past, between revenues and spending. The objective is to get there at the end of 1998, on condition that the employment situation does not become worse," he said. The social security's accounts commission is set to meet on September 23. In June, newspaper reports said the commission's unofficial forecast for the 1997 welfare deficit would be about 35 billion francs. Its prediction then for the 1996 welfare deficit was 48.6 billion, including 32.3 billion for health care. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
