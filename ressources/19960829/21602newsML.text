SIMEX Euroyen and Eurodollar futures ended little changed in quiet trading on Thursday. A dealer said Euroyen contracts saw some light profit taking after the sharp run-up on Wednesday, but the market was well supported at current levels. "The market is now looking for industrial production numbers tomorrow. Depending on how far off concensus the numbers turn out, the market could use it as another excuse to sell further," he said.   Dealers said the market undertone remained bullish as the Bank of Japan was expected to keep interest rates low to support what is seen as a weak economic recovery in the country. They said interest was also switching to March contracts as many dealers expect monetary policy to be unchanged until the end of the current fiscal year. December Euroyen ended at 99.31 against its CME close of 99.28. Volume was 8,920 contracts. March ended at 99.14 against its CME close of 99.10 on volume of 8,725 contracts. Japanese government bond futures also ended higher with September settling at 122.22 against its open at 121.75.   Eurodollars ended little change after moving within a tight range. Dealers said the market lacked fresh factors to move out its current range. "I think Chicago would like to take Eurodollars down a bit, but so far nothing is really happening," said a European bank dealer. He said market participants were mostly sidelined waiting for the August unemployment report next week. December contracts ended at 94.09 against its IMM close of 94.08. Volume was 5,745 contracts. -- Doreen Siow, Singapore newsroom (65 8703092)
