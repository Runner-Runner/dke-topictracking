Advance Bank Australia Ltd said on Thursday that it was planning to make another floating rate note issue similar to a US$250 million issue it made in June 1994. However, chairman Jim Service said the value and timing of the issue had not been settled. "The bank is going to make another issue, there will be an announcement about that very shortly," he said in response to a question at the annual meeting. He said the final details were currently under discussion with the company's lawyers and accountants.   Service also said the Advance Bank had not made a final decision about whether the issue would be made to shareholders as well as existing noteholders.
