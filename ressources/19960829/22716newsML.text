The European Union said on Thursday that rising tension in Jerusalem threatened the Middle East peace process and urged Palestinians and Israelis to show restraint and resume negotiations. "The whole peace process, which is a fundamental interest of the Union, could be undermined by this regression to direct confrontation," said Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, whose ccountry is current EU President. The statement was issued because of escalating tension in Jerusalem and the Occupied Territories following Israel's demolition of a Palestinian community hall and its decision to build more Jewish homes in the West Bank. "The Taniaste (Foreign Minister) calls on both sides to exercise restraint and to immediately re-engage themselves in the peace process," the statement said. Palestinian shops and businesses shut on Thursday for four hours across the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Israeli-annexed Arab East Jerusalem, in response to a strike call by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to protest against Israel's plans. The Middle East peace process is expected to be high on the agenda of an informal EU Foreign Ministers meeting chaired by Spring in the southern Irish town of Tralee in 10 days time.
