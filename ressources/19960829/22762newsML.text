Belgacom Mobile SA, unit of Belgian state-controlled telecommunications operator Belgacom SA, said on Thursday it would slash tariffs of its profitable Proximus GSM service from September 3. "Proximus bill falls 30 to 34 percent on average," it said in a statement on the price cuts, a move widely expected following the launch on Tuesday of Belgium's second mobile phone network by Belgo-French company  Mobistar. "Belgacom Mobile is decreasing its tariffs significantly to stimulate growth of the GSM market in Belgium and enable current or future users to be guided by the best price-quality ratio." Both companies will be fighting over one of Europe's least dense mobile phone markets, which analysts say has a massive potential to grow. Proximus, launched on January 1, 1994, has so far notched up 300,000 subscribers, around three percent of the estimated total market potential. Belgacom Mobile is 75-percent owned by Belgacom and 25 percent by AirTouch Communications Inc of the U.S. Belgacom is 49.9 percent owned by a consortium including U.S Ameritech, Singapore Telecom and Tele Danmark. Mobistar is owned 62 percent by France Telecom. Belgian data communications firm Telinfo NV has 10 percent and a group of eight other Belgian investors 28 percent. -- Bert Lauwers, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6815, Fax +32 2 230 7710
