Pakistan is considering buying another 200,000 tonnes of refined crystal white sugar for delivery in September and October, Food and Agriculture Minister Nawab Yousaf Talpur said on Thursday.   "We may be needing another 200,000 tonnes of sugar to meet demand," he told Reuters. He said that would take total imports in this fiscal year (July-June) to 500,000 tonnes. More imports might be needed in case domestic sugar output in 1996/97 fell short of its target of 3.1 million tonnes, he said. Demand was forecast at 2.8 million tonnes. Talpur said a lot would depend on sugarcane prices in the next two months and whether farmers decided to sell their cane to sugar mills or use it to make molasses. -- Tahir Ikram 9251-274757
