TransAlta New Zealand Ltd, the company expected to be formed from the merger of Energy Direct Ltd and Capital Power, forecast in a listing profile published on Thursday a net profit in the six months to March 1997 of $1.05 million and $22.57 million in the year to March 1998.   Chairman Ron Arbuckle noted the company's earnings were highly seasonal and the six months to March 31 would include around $5 million in restructuring costs arising from the merger of the two Wellington region power distributors. The merger is estimated to result in savings of $123 million according to a report by Price Waterhouse. A special meeting of the shareholders of Energy Direct will be held on September 16 to vote on the merger. Five resolutions must be passed for the merger to proceed. Canada's TransAlta Corp owns Capital Power and will end with 62.7 percent of the merged company.   The company expects to make around 200 of the two companies' 540 staff redundant. TransAlta NZ will have around 10 percent of the New Zealand power distribution market after the merger but would expect to need around double that when New Zealand's electricity reforms are complete, chief executive Mike Underhill said. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
