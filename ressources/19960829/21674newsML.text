The U.S. Agriculture Department Thursday forecast that U.S. farm exports, hobbled by tight supplies and stiff competition, would fall by $2 billion in fiscal 1997 from this year's record $60 billion. The department predicted that despite strong prices, wheat, feedgrain and cotton export volume would drop and shave sales of those commodities by $4 billion. But it estimated oilseed exports would increase by $800 million in 1997 and that shipments abroad of livestock, poultry and fruits and vegetables would gain more than $1 billion. Analysts were not surprised by the dip and noted that, while 1997 farm exports might pale compared to last year's booming total, they were nothing to scoff at. "Historically, these are tremendous figures. It's just that it compares to such an excellent year last year," said Bill Nelson, a grain market analyst at Doanes Agricultural Services in St. Louis. "Clearly this is still projections and doesn't preclude that exports will turn out a little better," he added. U.S. wheat exports were pegged at 25.0 million metric tons in 1997, down from 32.0 million tons in the prior year. U.S. wheat faces tough competition from producers like Argentina, Australia and Canada, which are expected to enter the market with increased supplies this year at lower prices than U.S. grain. The Agriculture Department forecast corn exports at 51.5 million tons, vs. 55.0 million tons seen for this year. It estimated fiscal 1997 U.S. soybean exports at 22.3 million tons, down slightly from 22.4 million tons for 1996 and pegged cotton exports at 1.5 million tons versus 1.7 million tons forecast for fiscal 1996. The fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept 30. Overall, USDA estimated U.S. exports of bulk commodities would total 109.1 million tons in fiscal 1997, down sharply from this year's forecast 120.2 million tons because of tight U.S. supplies and abundant crops worldwide. Foul weather sapped U.S. wheat production this year and the small crop resulted in higher prices and constrained exports. This year's corn crop, while forecast as the fourth-largest on record, would barely be large enough to meet demand and do little to rebuild stocks. U.S. agricultural imports were forecast at a record $32 billion in fiscal 1997, up $500 million from this year. USDA also raised its fiscal 1996 import estimate by $1 billion to $31.5 billion. Agricultural trade is a consistent bright spot in the U.S. balance of trade picture. USDA projected a trade surplus of $28.5 billion for this year and $26 billion in fiscal 1997. Exports account for about 25 cents of each dollar in cash receipts by U.S. farmers.
