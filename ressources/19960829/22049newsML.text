The Pakistani rupee is likely to depreciate by about four percent by the end of 1996 amid rising inflation, low exports and pressure on foreign reserves, analysts said on Thursday. "The exchange rate is likely to keep crawling towards 37 rupees against the dollar by December," said the treasury head of a foreign bank, who asked not to be named. The State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP) depreciated the rupee on Thursday to 35.6200/35.8337 to the dollar from 35.5300/35.7077 fixed on August 13. It gave no reason for the depreciation, the latest in a series by the central bank, which operates a managed float of the increasingly embattled local currency. "Looking at the trade deficit, slim reserves and high inflation, we can see the central bank striking down the rupee further," dealer Sajjad Manakni of BMA Capital Management said. He said an average monthly depreciation of around 0.30 rupees could take the official rate to around 37 by December. The rupee has fallen 0.85 percent this month and 1.48 percent since July 1, the start of fiscal 1996/97. It has lost four percent of its dollar value since January 1. The rupee lost 13.2 percent of its dollar value in 1995/96, including a one-step seven percent devaluation in October as part of emergency measures to stabilise the economy. The trade gap widened to a provisional $270 million in July from $95 million in June, against $297 million in July 1995. The deficit for the whole of 1995/96 (July-June) swelled to a provisional $3.07 billion from $2.26 billion in 1994/95. Foreign reserves, including gold, dropped to $2.52 billion at the end of June from $3.51 billion a year earlier. Analyst Munir Ladha of AKD Securities said the growing disparity between the official and unofficial rates would exert further pressure on the rupee, which opened 0.06 down in the kerb market at 39.19 to the dollar on Thursday. Dealers said more dollar buying was expected to push the rupee further down at the close, ahead of the Friday weekend. "The widening gap shows investors have lost confidence in the economy. We fear the gap may widen so much that the official rate would cease to have any importance for market," Lhada said. He predicted that the kerb (unofficial) rate could race to 48 rupees to the dollar by the end of 1996. "Unless the government puts its management of fiscal policy on the right track, we are heading for hyper-inflation," he added. Pakistan's consumer price index rose 10.32 percent in July year-on-year, compared to 10.30 percent in June and 11.84 percent in July 1995, though many economists believe the official figures significantly understate inflation.
