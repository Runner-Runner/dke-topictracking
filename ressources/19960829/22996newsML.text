Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp outlined on Thursday the benefits worth several tens of millions of dollars they expect from their worldwide alliance to reunite the Hilton hotel brand. Asked about cost savings from the deal, Hilton Hotels Corp chief executive Stephen Bollenbach said he saw "tens of millions of dollars initially". Peter George, Ladbroke's CEO, said that joint marketing of the Hilton brand around the world should be worth tens of millions of dollars to each company from 1998/99. "It seems all upside, it's hard to see a downside," George said.   George saw great potential from the extension of Hilton Corp's loyalty programme to all Hilton hotels worldwide. Bollenbach said there were very few costs associated with the agreement. "The costs are nominal -- just those for documenting what we have agreed. It's really not an expensive deal," he said. Under the deal, expected to be finalised shortly and become effective early next year, Hilton Hotels Corp plans to take a five percent stake in Ladbroke. George said that Ladbroke did not plan to take an equity stake in Hilton Hotels Corp for the moment.   Asked about the possibilities of the two companies eventually proceeding to a full merger, Bollenbach said: "In the fullness of time, there are perhaps further opportunities." But he said that the alliance was the best deal for both parties at this point. "Primarily we saw that we could get most of the advantages of a merger without actually consummating it," he said. The two men said they had been working on the deal since Bollenbach took up his position at Hilton Hotels in February and reached agreement only on Wednesday night.   Bollenbach said that the alliance should not result in job losses. "We are both growth companies and this will make us grow even faster. This is a deal where we provide more opportunities for more people," he said. -- Keith Weir, London Newsroom +44 171  542 8793
