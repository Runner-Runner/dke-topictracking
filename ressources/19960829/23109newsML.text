Australia will need to spend about A$12 billion to meet projected demand for new power, Keith Orchison, executive director of the Electricity Supply Association of Australia Ltd said on Thursday. Some 10,000 megawatts of additional power is required by 2010 to keep pace with growing power needs linked to population growth, Orchison said in an interview. The additional megawatts would lift Australia's total power capacity to about 48,000 megawatts, Orchison said. "Demand is being driven by population growth of around 12 percent in the next 10 years," Orchison said.   Orchison said that as more power capacity was introduced in Australia, the role of coal as the dominant power-generating source would be eroded in favour of gas. Coal currently holds about 82 percent of the market, although Orchison saw that share falling to between 50 and 60 percent by 2010. "Coal-fired stations tend to be tied to their mines, which means inevitably they have to build lots of transmission lines," Orchison said. "Gas-line power can be put pretty much where the market is."   On top of the A$12 billion in new funding, a further A$14 billion would be needed to exploit more of Australia's gas resources, Orchison said. "There will be quite siginificant demands placed on gas producers to meet this need," he said. The additional gas would come from know deposits, including the Bass Straits, the Cooper Basin and the gas fields of the Timor Sea, Orchison said. It was unlikely, though that a west-east pipeline linking the gas-rich fields of Western Australia with the eastern states would be built, Orchison said.   "That was an idea of the 1970s," he said -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
