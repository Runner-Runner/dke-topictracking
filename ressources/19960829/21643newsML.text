-- Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai ended up across the board on Thursday, with turnover rising to 14.45 million lots from 6.11 million on Wednesday. The annual rate for the most active three-day contract closed up at 17.00 percent from 15.20 percent and the seven-day contract rose to 13.50 percent from 10.15. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills. Traders said the rise of the short-term contracts was mainly due to active trading on the domestic A share market today, which attracted a large volume funds from the repo market.   The eight contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly down on a technical correction, traders said. Combined market volume rose to 6.80 million lots from 4.64 million. The most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 closed lower at 122.20 yuan from 123.71. The new three-year bond that matures in August 1999 fell to 105.28 yuan from 105.50. Traders said the downtrend of the ten-year bond was mainly due to institutional selling. "Since the 10-year bond had consolidated for several days, institutions want to sell it for cash to speculate in the A share market," said one trader. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004
