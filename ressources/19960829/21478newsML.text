A bill cutting taxes on Brazilian exports and manufacturing will be put to a vote in the Brazilian Senate in the second week of September, a senator said. The upper house is scheduled to vote on a motion giving the bill priority treatment Sept. 9, and then on the bill itself two days later, Senator Ney Suassuna, deputy leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) told reporters. The bill was approved in the lower house on Tuesday but will be kept on ice next week because many senators are expected to remain in their constituencies to campaign for October and November's municipal elections. The bill is expected to boost Brazilian exports by four percent and give the econony a shot in the arm. It would do away with an ICMS sales and circulation tax on exports and on capital goods, power and other items consumed by manufacturers. -- William Schomberg, Brasilia newsroom 5561 2230358
