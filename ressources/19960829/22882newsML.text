Austrian viscose fibres maker Lenzing AG said on Thursday it expected to post losses in the second half on the same level as those in the first six months. "Losses in the second half will be roughly the same size," said chief executive Heinrich Stepniczka at the company's first-half earnings conference.   Earlier, Lenzing reported a group pre-tax loss in the first six months of 84.5 million schillings, down from a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period. Lenzing posted a net loss of 85.7 million schillings after a profit of 117.8 million. Lenzing shares fell in thin volume on the news, briefly touching a new low for the year at 600 schillings, but settled later at 672 schillings, 0.6 percent down. - Julia Ferguson, Vienna newsroom, +431 53112 274
