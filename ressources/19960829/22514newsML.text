Turkish shares posted minor gains in narrow and selective trade on Thursday, brokers said. "There has to be more cash entry for the market to pierce its upper limit. Selective trade looks likely to continue," said Huseyin Istanbullu from Meksa Securities. The IMKB-100 went up by 0.73 percent or 466.48 points to end at 64,533.37. Weekly losses totalled 0.7 percent. Daily volume was steady at 6.2 trillion lira versus 6.3 trillion on Wednesday. Brokers said the market had strains piercing the strong 64,700 resistance level in limited cash entry. Brokers said the market had been dragged higher as players bought ahead of a three-day long weekend, taking advantage of the fact that they could pay on Monday. Brokers had sold on Monday and Tuesday to tie their cash to three-day repos ahead of a long weekend starting from Friday, a national holiday. Players who sold on Tuesday can get their cash today due to the Exchange's two-day settlement rule. The session's most active shares were those of the utility Cukurova Elektrik which gained 1,000 lira to end at 67,000. The C series shares of Isbank also rose by 400 lira to 9,600. The 85-share industrial index gained 0.30 percent to 70,776.73 and the 15-share financial index surged by 1.84 percent to 57,199.45. Of the 219 shares traded, losers outdid gainers by 78 to 67 and 74 shares were stable. -- Istanbul Newsroom, +90-212-275 0875
