A recovery expedition lifted a giant slab of the RMS Titanic's hull from its watery ocean grave on Thursday, 84 years after the ship struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean, an expedition spokesman said. The 20-tonne piece of steel hull was hovering at the water's surface, still attached to several diesel-filled bags that were used to raise it from the ocean floor, said Todd Tarantino, spokesman for New York-based RMS Titanic Inc., which is sponsoring the expedition. Recovery crews hoped to move the hull from the water to recovery ship Jim Kilabuck, anchored off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, later on Thursday, he said. "They're moving very slowly," he said. Plans call for the piece of debris to be taken to Boston on Saturday and to New York City on Sunday. The wreckage has been lying in water more than 2 1/2 miles (3 km) deep. The steel-hulled Titanic, thought to be unsinkable, struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912, and sank, killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The wreck was located in 1985. The expedition tried unsuccessfully twice earlier this week to retrieve the hull but technical hitches and equipment problems delayed them. As part of the recovery expedition, more than 1,700 people including three survivors of the doomed liner's first trans-Atlantic voyage sailed in two ships from Boston and New York to the site, paying $1,500 and up for a nine-day cruise. RMS Titanic, which holds the rights to the ship's debris, has recovered some 4,000 artifacts since 1987. It hopes to use the hull section as the centerpiece of an exhibition next spring and possibly a full-fledged Titanica museum. The U.S.-based Discovery Channel on cable television, NBC television network and Britain's Channel Four all plan to release documentaries about the recovery mission.
