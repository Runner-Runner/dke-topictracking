Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Thursday that the government would in future need to approve any rises in private health insurance premiums.   Howard said he regretted the latest round of premium rises, approved by a Health Department official this week despite the government's budget decision to offer tax rebates worth A$500 million a year to encourage people to join private health funds. "Any future increases in health insurance premiums will have to be approved by the Minister for Health in consulation with the Treasurer and myself," Howard told reporters in Brisbane. Two health funds have already decided to raise their premiums, and others are expected to follow suit. Howard said his government had discovered that under an arrangement with the former Labor government, approval for premium increases was delegated to Health Department officers. "The Minister for Health (was) advised in an ad hoc way by one of the funds that the latest increases had been approved," Howard told a Queensland state Liberal Party meeting here. He said he would now ask the acting health minister to revoke the delegation of power. -- Canberra burea 613-9286-1421
