Phillips Petroleum plans to pull out of the Statoil-operated Tommeliten licence in the Norwegian North Sea with effect from early November, Statoil newsletter Status Weekly said on Thursday. Statoil, or Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap AS, said a week ago Norwegian authorities and licence partners for the Tommeliten oil and gas field were considering plans to abandon the development. The field, which came on stream in 1988, is due to cease production in late 1997 or early 1998. It pumped 2,970 barrels per day in July, according to Statoil figures. The newsletter said a decision would be taken later on how to divide the company's 25.87 percent interest in production licence 044 between the other partners. Statoil is the biggest of these, with a 50 percent share including the government's direct financial interest of 30 percent. Fina has 15 percent and Norsk Agip 9.13 percent. The licencees have agreed on a new exploration well in block 1/9 next year. This 1/9-7 well will be drilled into a prospect in the Tommeliten Alpha structure, the report said. -- Oslo newsroom +47 22 42 50 41
