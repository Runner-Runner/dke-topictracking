Norwich Union Financial Services Group (NUFSG) said on Thursday it would buy 50 percent of Australian fund manager GRW Property Ltd and GRW would manage A$300 million of Norwich's Australian property funds. GRW manages the A$216 million Australian listed National Industrial Property Trust and launched a wholesale specialist property fund, the Australian Industrial Property Fund in May which is targeting A$250 million of funds. NUFSG is a unit of British-based financial services group Norwich Union. Norwich Union has about A$4.5 billion worth of funds under management in Australia.   NUFSG's A$300 million Australian property portfolio includes retail and industrial property Australia-wide. "This agreement means Norwich can now offer specialist services in the growing area of property funds management," said NUFSG group managing director, Peter Jonson. NUFSG has said it may list on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1997 or 1998 and could list earlier than this if it found a suitable acquisition target. Norwich Union, which has A$73 billion worth of funds under management world-wide has said it was considering floatation. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800
