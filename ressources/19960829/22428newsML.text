The worldwide hotel alliance between Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp looks like a good deal which should begin to provide substantial benefit from 1998, analysts said on Thursday. Paul Heath of UBS said that the alliance, which will reunite the Hilton brand for the first time since 1964, could add as much as 25 million stg to pre-tax profit in 1998. "Ladbroke should get quite a big step-up in business across their 160 hotels," he said, adding this should outweigh the company's investment in the alliance. "We are upping our ladbroke numbers (forecasts) as a result of it."   UBS are forecasting full-year 1996 pre-tax profit of 175 million stg against 121.3 million in 1995. They expect that to rise to 225 million stg in 1997 and 275 million stg the following year. Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC) owns the Hilton name within the U.S., while Ladbroke has the rights to it everywhere else in the world through its Hilton International (HIC) unit. The two companies have signed an outline agreement to cooperate on sales and marketing, loyalty programmes and hotel development. HHC intends to take a five percent stake in Ladbroke when the deal is finalised.   Ladbroke said it has no immediate plans to take a stake in HHC but said it expected to invest significant sums in hotels and casinos developed by the company in the United States. The agreement provides for a 20 percent profit participation in each other's hotel development in return for a 20 percent contribution to any required capital investment. Fraser Ramzan of Lehman Brothers said it was not clear whether HHC would acquire its stake in Ladbroke by buying existing equity or whether new shares would be issued. "A possible purchase gives some support to the share price but the fact that there might be more in issue is negative," he said.   Ladbroke shares were 2.5p firmer at 210 at 1440 GMT, having earlier touched a 1996 high of 215p. Looking at the deal itself, Ramzan said that its benefits were difficult to quantify and that it would have more of a long-term impact on performance. "I like the look of it it but we need to see what happens on completion," he said. Lehman Brothers are forecasting 1996 pre-tax profit of 158 million stg and a 1997 figure of 196 million stg, although Ramzan said that figure could be revised upwards. Greg Feehely of Kleinwort Benson was positive on the deal.   "The Hilton tie-up is more extensive than people expected. We are expecting big things from 1998 onwards," he said. He saw great potential for cost savings with the introduction of global purchasing agreements for non-perishable goods in Hilton hotels worldwide. He added that the HHC stake in Ladbroke could act as a poison bill to ward off potential bidders such as British brewing to leisure group Bass Plc. Kleinwort Benson is forecasting 1996 pre-tax profit of 165 million stg and is looking for 210 million stg in 1997. -- Keith Weir, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8793
