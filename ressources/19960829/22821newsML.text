French President Jacques Chirac travels to Bonn on Sunday for talks and dinner with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Chirac's office announced on Thursday. The two leaders, whose countries are considered the driving engine of European unity, will confer on a broad range of topics including bilateral, European and international issues, aides said. But defence cooperation and European monetary union are likely to get special attention due to German anger over French military reform plans and growing speculation that France may not be able to qualify for a single European currency. Against a backdrop of an economic slowdown and rising unemployment, Paris must make tough budget cuts to reduce its public deficits enough to meet the 1997 criteria for monetary union. In defence, the French and German foreign ministers said this month that they were on the path to putting their differences behind them over plans by Paris to withdraw some of its troops from German soil. Chirac unveiled in July a major streamlining of the armed forces that will involve disbanding 38 regiments, closing barracks, army hospitals and air bases. The plan, part of a shift to a smaller, all-professional army, would include major cuts in French forces based on German soil since the end of World War Two. But French Defence Minister Charles Millon assured his German counterpart Volker Ruehe at a mid-August meeting that Paris would proceed gradually with its reform plan, in constant contact with its close ally. Chirac and Kohl last met in June, after a summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in the central French city of Lyon.  REUTER
