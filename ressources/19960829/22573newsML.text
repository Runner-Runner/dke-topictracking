Amtrol Inc., a leading water flow and control company, has a definitive agreement to sell all of its common stock to the Cypress Group for $28.25 per share or $218.9 million in cash, the companies said Thursday. Amtrol's stock surged $7.125 to $27.375 on Nasdaq at mid-morning. The deal will be structured as a merger between the company and a Cypress affiliate, A.I. Acquisition Inc. The merger, unanimously approved by Amtrol's board, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Shareholders owning about 37.8 percent of Amtrol's stock, including members of senior management, have agreed to vote in favour of the deal. "The acquisition of Amtrol fits perfectly with Cypress' growth-oriented investment philosophy," said David P. Spalding, vice chairman of Cypress. "Amtrol has strong brand names, leading market share and has demonstrated exceptional sales and earnings stability. It will serve as an excellent platform for growth." A key part of Cypress' plan will be to introduce new Amtrol products and to expand the company's brands internationally. West Warwick, R.I.-based Amtrol is a leading North American producer and marketer of flow and expansion control technology used in water systems and heating, ventilation and air conditioning products. It also makes returnable containers for refrigerant gases. It had 1995 revenues of $172.5 million. New York-based Cypress manages a private equity fund which closed in February 1996 with more than $1 billion in commitments. It invests in privately negotiated transactions, targeting established operating businesses and investing with management to foster continued growth. Most recently Cypress purchased a 44 percent stake in Cinemark USA Inc., the fifth-largest theatre operator in the country.
