The rapeseed harvest in eastern Germany is expected to be down by 46.6 percent on last year while production in western Germany should be down 27.5 percent as a result of a harsh winter, the Bonn farm ministry said. Farm minister Jochen Borchert told a press conference on Thursday the overall 1996 rapeseed harvest was estimated at two million tonnes versus 3.1 million tonnes last year. Pan-German yields were put at 2.27 tonnes per hectare, versus 3.19 tonnes in 1995. Yield losses in the East were put at one-third and those in the West at 20 percent. The ministry pegged the rapeseed area at 855,000 ha, 12 percent less than in 1995. It said winter damage reduced the winter rapeseed area in western Germany by 13.5 percent and in eastern Germany by 19.2 percent. Extended spring rape sowings could not offset these losses. The ministry put the total oilseeds (rape and sunflowerseed) area at 898,000 ha, 12.5 percent down from 1995, of which 247,000 ha were for non-food purposes, leaving a food area of 651,000 ha. Germany thus undercut its food oilseeds area limit of 836,000 ha under an EU/U.S. agreement by 185,000 ha, or 22.1 percent. --Vera Eckert, Bonn newsroom, 49 228 26097146
