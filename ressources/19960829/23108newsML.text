Property for Industry on Thursday announced a two for five issue of rights to ordinary shares on ordinary shares and options at NZ$0.70 per share. Books close on September 13.   The company said the renounceable issue aimed to raise NZ$29.6 million, and was expected to be fully underwritten by Ord Minnett Securities NZ. Property for Industry said the new shares from the date of issue rank pari passu with existing ordinary shares. The company saw more opportunities to buy prime industrial properties on attractive yields, and had already purchased five since the start of 1996. Together with ongoing investment in its existing portfolio, this meant it was nearly fully invested under its policy of limiting debt to total assets to 35 percent.   "The Directors of PFI believe that the environment for purchasing prime industrial property is likely to remain favourable during the second half of 1996 and 1997. "This, combined with the other benefits associated with increasing size of the company such as spreading risk, diversifying the shareholder base and improving liquidity, was a key factor in the decision to proceed with the rights issue," it said. -- Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746
