The Malaysian government has appointed Britain's National Grid Group Plc as consultants to examine state power firm Tenaga Nasional Bhd's operations following the nationwide blackout early this month. The national Bernama news agency quoted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as saying on Thursday that the decision on the appointment was made at the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The National Grid Group was also appointed as consultant by the government after a massive power failure which hit most parts of peninsular Malaysia in September 1992.   The latest power outage, which occurred on August 3 and blacked out peninsular Malaysia for 12-15 hours, triggered official outrage and embarrassment. Tenaga's executive chairman will be replaced when his term expires this month. State-controlled Tenaga said the outage was traced to a faulty component in a circuit breaker at its Paka power plant in Terengganu state on the east coast. Afer the 1992 blackout Tenaga appointed National Grid to recommend measures to improve electricity supply and minimise or eliminate the recurrence of a complete interruption of power supply. Since the consultant's report four years ago, Tenaga said it has implemented 94 percent of the recommendations. The power supply interruption in 1992 was caused by lightning and also involved the Paka power plant. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603 230 8911)
