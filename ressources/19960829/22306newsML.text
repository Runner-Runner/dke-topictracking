Mexican shares fell on thin U.S. volumes Thursday as news of guerrilla attacks in southern Mexico fuelled profit-taking. "People are using this as an excuse to take profits," a trader said. "Volumes are thin, and the Dow's not helping things any." Traders expected the guerrilla attacks, which left several people dead, to keep investors on the sidelines ahead of the long U.S. holiday weekend. "The market will probably drift while people wait for things to settle down," a trader said.   Blue chip Telmex's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) shed over two percent, dropping 3/4 to 33-3/8, while Televisa lost 1/2 to 30-3/4. Several other Mexican ADRs topped the New York Stock Exchange's percent loss leaders, with Grupo Mexicano off 10 percent, dropping 1/4 to 2-1/4, Tribasa falling five percent, losing 1/4 to 5-1/8, and Serfin down five percent, falling 1/4 to 5-1/8. Most other Latin American shares also fell, under pressure from the Dow, although Brazil's Telebras managed to stretch its gains.   The Brazilian bellwether inched up 3/8 to 76-1/2 after it reported strong seven-month results. Argentine shares extended their losses in dull trade, with YPF off 3/8 at 20-3/4, Telefonica down 1/2 at 23-1/4, and Banco de Galicia falling 3/8 to 20-3/4. "Argentina's asleep. It's a completely trader-driven market, with some of the local funds pushing it around," a trader said.   Chilean shares were also quiet, with CTC off 3/8 at 97-1/4 on paltry volumes, Andina up 1/4 at 33-1/2, and Enersis flat at 31-1/4. In other activity, Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services ADRs fell over five percent, dropping 1-33/64 to 27-3/8 after the company announced plans for a secondary offering. --New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.
