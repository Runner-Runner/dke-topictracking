Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc said it and the tobacco industry as a whole were still confident that U.S. tobacco litigants would ultimately make no significant progress. In a letter to be posted to shareholders, B.A.T said it was also confident that the recent award of damages against it to a plaintiff who suffered from lung cancer would be overturned.   "Notwithstanding this, the litigious framework in the US means that we will see continuing activity in the courtrooms of America," B.A.T said in the letter. The letter follows the slump in B.A.T's share price after news last week of the lung cancer award by a Florida court and on moves by President Clinton to support the Food and Drug Administration's proposal limiting youth access to tobacco products. Shares in the group, which plunged to a year-low of around 420 pence on the two developments, have since moved up to 448-1/2 pence.   Referring to Clinton's approval for the new FDA regulations on youth access, B.A.T said it strongly opposed government regulations "whose true purpose is to restrict the rights of adults to smoke...". "It is very unfortunate that the discussions between the US administration and members of the US tobacco businesses...have been sacrificed to political grandstanding ahead of the US Presidential elections in November," it added. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 7717
