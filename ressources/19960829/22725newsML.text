Germany's 1996 grain crop was estimated at 41 million tonnes compared with 39.9 million tonnes, the Bonn farm ministry said on Thursday. The ministry also said the average yield would be 6.1 tonnes per hectare, unchanged from last year. The ministry stressed the figure was preliminary because harvesting was delayed. Only two-thirds of grain had been cut in the west, while in the east, only 30 to 50 percent had been harvested. --Bonn newsroom, 49 228 26097150
