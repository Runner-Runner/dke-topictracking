VideoLan Technologies Inc said on Thursday it was unaware of any "operational, technological, or market reasons" for recent stock price declines or fluctuations. But the company said it is aware of substantial short positions in its stock.   "We are aware there are a number of people who have large blocks of the company stock and are shorting it," said Peter Beck, VideoLan's chief operating officer. He said that may be a reason for the stock activity. Beck also said there were a number of "misleading rumors" circulating about the company and its underwriter but would not comment further. VideoLan said its shipments of the VL2000, a desktop video conferencing and distribution product, are consistent with its expectation that it would realize meaningful revenue in the third and fourth quarters this year. VideoLan's stock shed 5/8 to close at 7-7/8. Earlier in the day, the stock hit is 52-week low of 7-3/8.
