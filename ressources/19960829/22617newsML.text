U.S. Robotics Corp said Thursday it has completed its acquisition of  Scorpio Communications Ltd for about $72 million in cash. A preliminary agreement, announced in July, was a stock transaction valued at about $80 million. Scorpio, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, designs, manufactures and sells equipment used for local area networks.   According to the preliminary acquisition agreement, if there was a significant drop in the price of U.S. Robotics stock, U.S. Robotics could terminate the deal, company spokeswoman Karen Novak said. On July 2, the day the proposed deal was announced, U.S. Robotics' stock was trading at $90 a share. It traded Thursday at 53-1/8, off 1-3/8 from Wednesday's close. As a result of the stock price decline, U.S. Robotics was able to renegotiate, she said. "During the summer, the market revalued all tech companies and we were one of them and we renegotiated a new price," Novak told Reuters.   In late July, U.S. Robotics said its proposed acquisition of Scorpio would be accounted for as a purchase, and that has not changed, she said. Also at that time, U.S. Robotics said it would take a significant one-time charge against fourth quarter earnings related to the transaction. Under revised terms, earnings will still be reduced by the charge. Again, the amount of the charge was withheld. "The acquisition of Scorpio helps round out our LAN switching offerings, giving us a more comprehensive portfolio of switching and ATM products to offer our customers," said Surya Panditi, who was recently appointed general manager of U.S. Robotics' Network Systems Division LAN Infrastructure business.
