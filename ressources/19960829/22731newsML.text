Views on the future direction of Belgian linear bonds are almost perfectly divided, leaving the market more likely to move sideways than any other direction for the next few weeks, traders said on Thursday. "Nobody knows what to do at the moment. It is a very strange market," one trader said. Traders reported big buyers for five and 20-year paper offset by selling of 10-year maturities. They also noted that the five to 10-year yield curve was steepening strongly but at the same time the 10- to 20-year yield curve was flattening.   Some traders said they saw the market rallying, but others said its was already too high compared with both France and Germany and therefore due to fall. This counterbalancing of views left the market largely directionless with no overwhelming strategic targets, traders said, noting a lack of paper around. "The market is order driven at the moment," one trader said. -- Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6810, Fax +32 2 230 7710
