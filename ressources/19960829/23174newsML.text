Taiwan's bad-cheque ratio fell to 0.59 percent in July from 0.60 percent in June, the central bank said on Thursday. Bad cheques totalled 91,629, or 0.59 percent of July's total, with a value of T$17.7 billion, or 0.40 percent of the value of all cheques written, the bank said in a statement. The monthly bad-cheque ratio hit a 10-year high of 0.80 percent in October 1995, it said. In annual terms, 1995's 0.67 percent was also a 10-year peak, the highest since the ratio hit 0.75 percent in 1985. The bank attributed the rising number of bad cheques in 1995 to a slow economy and the slumping property and stock markets. The bad-cheque problems have eased gradually in recent months, it said. -- Taipei Newsroom (5080815)
