German luxury carmaker Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen AG, said on Thursday it had no plans for a new public share offering or to buy back the remaining shares not held by Volkswagen. "There are no plans for either a new share offering or to buy back the outstanding shares," Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel said in an interview. "We are liquid enough to finance our plans," he said, noting he had no plans to diversify Audi out of making cars. The balance of Audi shares not held by VW is about one percent. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
