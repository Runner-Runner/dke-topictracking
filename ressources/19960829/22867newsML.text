Results from the recently completed Siri-2 well in the Danish North Sea confirm Statoil's optimistic views about future development of the Siri oil field, the company's Status Weekly newsletter said on Thursday. On August 8, Norway's state-owned oil company Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap ASA (STATOIL), said a week ago the results of the new well would be important in determining the size of the reservoir in block 5604/20. "Everything went as expected," said Vidar B. Larsen, exploration manager at Statoil Efterforskning & Produktion in Denmark. Siri-2 was drilled to a depth of 2,294 metres in block 5604/20 by the jack-up Maersk Enhancer as the first appraisal well on the field. The rig will now be moved to a position about 9.5 kilometres north east of Siri-1 in order to spud the Siri-3 exploration well in block 5605/13, the newsletter said. Statoil in December said the Siri discovery could produce between 40,000 and 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, increasing Denmark's average daily output by around 25 percent. Denmark produced a record 208,337 bpd of oil in July, according to latest figures from the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC). Preliminary figures from testing the SIRI-1 well put estimated recoverable reserves at 150 million barrels of oil. Statoil, is co-operator on Siri with Danop. Other partners are Enterprise Oil Plc, Dansk Olie og Gasproduktion and Denerco. --Oslo newsroom, +47 22 42 50 41
