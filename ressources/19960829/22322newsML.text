Teradyne Inc said Thursday it is making a workforce reduction of about 300, including regular employees, temporary employees, and contractors due to the semiconductor industry downturn. As a result of the workforce reduction, Teradyne said, it expects to take a pretax charge  of $10 to $12 million, equal to $0.07 to $0.08 per share after taxes, in the last half of the year. The amount and timing of these charges are subject to a number of uncertainties, including the nature of the extended benefits provided to the affected employees. The affected people were notified beginning August 28. They will receive extended benefits based on length of service, as well as outplacement assistance, the company said. About 175 of the affected people are located in Boston while the remainder of the jobs will be reduced in Teradyne's West Coast operations. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.
