Dragages et Travaux Publics said on Thursday it won a US$9.4 million contract to build a conference centre in Hanoi, the Bouygues unit's first contract in Vietnam since 1975. Dragages was founded in Vietnam in 1902 and had a presense there until 1976. A representative office was reopened in 1994. The contract for the 7,200 sq m conference centre was awarded to Dragages and local joint-venture partner Licogi by the Vietnamese government and is being jointly funded by the Vietnamese and French governments. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843-6441
