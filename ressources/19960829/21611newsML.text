Bangchak Petroleum Plc has awarded one million barrels of Oman crude oil to one company in its October buying tender, sources said on Thursday.   The sources said the award was made at just under MPM plus 2.5 cents per barrel on an fob basis. They said more than 10 cargoes of Oman had been offered into the tender. A cargo of Iranian crude and a cargo of Murban crude, which were also offered into the tender, were not awarded, the sources said. The tender had sought Far East crude also, but the sources said no Far East offers were made.   Bangchak had cancelled its September crude buying tender for Far East crudes because of high offers. In August, the refinery company awarded two million barrels of Oman crude per quarter in a one-year term tender. --Singapore Newsroom (+65 870 3081)
