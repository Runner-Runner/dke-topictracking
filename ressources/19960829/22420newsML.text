UK overnight money market rates ended a shade higher after a quiet day in which they traded mainly between 5-1/2 and 6.0 percent. The Bank of England acted in the early round to take out more than half of a hefty 1.8 billion stg liquidity shortage. Although rates shifted higher again around noon, they slipped back towards the close as the shortage was fully covered. "It's been up and down. I don't think huge volumes were done," one trader said. "People were squaring cash positions ahead of the monetary meeting next week." Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke holds his monthly monetary meeting with Bank of England Governor Eddie George on September 4. Although George has warned against futher interest rate cuts, some operators believe Clarke may seize on recent money supply and retail sales data to justify a fifth successive cut in rates from their present 5.75 percent level. Late quotes showed overnight cash around 5-3/4 1/2. Rates out to two months were steady at 5-3/4 11/16. The gilt repo market also had a quiet session, with bonds such as the 6.0 percent gilt due 1999 and the 8.0 percent of 2003 trading at around 25 points below general collateral (GC) levels. The latest auction stock, the 7.5 of 2006, was quoted at similar levels. "Interest in specials hasn't been that strong compared to a couple of weeks ago when there was quite a lot going on," one trader said. Overnight GC rates largely tracked those in the unsecured market, starting off above 6.0 percent but easing back to around 5.75 percent in later business. -- Richard Murphy, London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774
