A Massachusetts woman pleaded guilty to embezzling more than $310,000 from the local chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the state's attorney general said in a statement late Wednesday. Harriet Roberts, 60, was treasurer of the Bay State Chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, while her husband, Jason Roberts 63, was a founding member. From 1990 to 1994, Mrs. Roberts made check and cash withdrawals from the charity's bank accounts, then deposited them into her and her husband's personal accounts, using the funds for insurance payments, taxes and other expenses. She forged the signature of a former charity officer on several of the checks in order to circumvent the charity's policy requiring that each check drawn on a charity bear the signatures of two chapter officials, prosecutors said. She pleaded guilty to seven counts of larceny, one count of forgery and four counts of filing false tax returns from 1990 to 1993, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger said in the statement. Charges are pending against her husband. Mrs. Roberts is scheduled for sentencing on Oct. 3 in Norfolk Superior Court.
