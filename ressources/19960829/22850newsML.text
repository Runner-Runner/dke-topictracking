Shares in German industrial conglomerate Daimler-Benz AG reversed early gains to trade lower on Thursday, a drop attributed to profit-taking after the group reported strong first-half results. Daimler stock was down 12 pfennigs at 81.20 marks at 1021 GMT, after earlier hitting a session high of 81.80 marks. The stock started to drop after the group reported first-half operating profit of 827 million marks, on the top end of expectations. Dealers said there had been strong interest in Daimler in the run-up to the results and that the drop was due to profit-taking. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
