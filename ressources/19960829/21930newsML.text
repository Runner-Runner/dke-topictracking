Banco Portugues de Investimentos (BPI) intends to consolidate Banco de Fomento & Exterior (BFE) from fourth quarter 1995, said analysts who attended a bank briefing on the takeover. "The chairman told us that he expected the consolidation in the fourth quarter," said one analyst at the briefing with BPI chief Artur Santos Silva on Wednesday night. The briefing was held just hours after the Lisbon bourse announced the 2,615 escudos per share price of BPI's successful bid to buy the state's 65 percent stake in BFE. BPI will make a 60 billion escudo capital call to pay for the takeover in which it will also have to buy up BFE stock on the market. The BPI board will meet September 17 to decide the exact terms of the capital call to put to shareholders towards the end of October. --Sergio Goncalves, Lisbon bureau 3511-3150035
