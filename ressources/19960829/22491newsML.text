The UK's Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) said on Thursday it had fined Save & Prosper Equity Plan Managers Limited 115,000 stg for breaches of its rules relating to its Personal Equity Plans (PEPs) invested directly in equities. Compensation of around 69,000 stg has been paid by Save & Prosper to 4,600 PEP customers and 30,000 stg has been reimbursed to 849 former customers, IMRO said in a statement. The breaches took place between November 1991 and May 1996.   The investment watchdog said Save & Prosper had agreed to a settlement of disciplinary proceedings brought for failing to carry out stock and client money reconciliations in accordance with its rules. It had also allowed overdrafts to occur on client money accounts and failed to pay on time all amounts due to its PEP customers following closure of their accounts. Save & Prosper failed to invest customers' money on time or re-invest income earned on their PEPs and failed to maintain adequate written procedures for the completion of reconciliations and the processing of new business.   Save & Prosper had remedied the deficiencies and is to pay IMRO's costs of 31,000 stg, IMRO added. -- Alexander Smith, London Newsroom ++ 44 171 542 7719
