Indian shares fell off their day's peaks but still finished broadly higher on Thursday and brokers said they expected prices to hold firm. "The market has been oversold," said one trader. "I expect some of those positions being reversed." Traders said sentiment was being pushed by talk of some tax reliefs to certain sections of industry before the budget is passed by parliament next month. The 30-share benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index finished 54.81 points, or 1.59 percent, higher at 3,493.61 after rising to 3,528.19.   The delayed 1996/97 (April-March) budget was presented to parliament last month and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram is likely to speak on the budget on Friday, officials said. He plans to make a more detailed reply on the finance bill, including offering any amendments to tax proposals, next month, probably on September 9 or 10, the official said in Delhi. The Economic Times said on Thursday that Chidambaram "has virtually made up his mind to grant tax relief to the steel industry." Finance Ministry officials declined comment. Analysts said sentiment was also buoyed by good corporate results and bountiful rains across the country.   TISCO gained 4.0 rupees to 195. P&G jumped 47.50 rupees to 647.50 after the firm's net profit rose to 262.3 million rupees in year to June 30, 1996 from 139.9 million in previous year. ACC firmed 34.75 rupees to 2,159.75 on news the company's cement sales were up at 3.10 million tonnes during April-July 1996 against 2.93 million tonnes in the year-ago period. Gujarat Ambuja Cement rose 13 rupees to 322 after its net profit rose 47 percent to 1.48 billion rupees in the year to June 30, 1996 from 1.0 billion a year ago.
