Iran has denied a U.S. claim that Tehran was involved in an Iraqi scheme to sell oil in violation of United Nations sanctions. Iran's U.N. envoy Kamal Kharazi late on Wednesday "dismissed the U.S. claims that Tehran has been involved in Baghdad's violation of the U.N. economic sanctions by allowing Iraqi ships to smuggle oil through Iranian waters," the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Thursday. A U.S. official at the U.N. said that Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces were collecting protection money from shippers, allowing the illegal movement of Iraqi gasoil through the Gulf. Kharazi said "the claims are part of Washington's anti-Iran propaganda, which as always are based on false and unfounded allegations". Citing a June 17 U.S. letter to the U.N. sanctions committee, IRNA said in a dispatch from United Nations headquarters in New York: "The latest U.S. efforts to allege Iran of violating the U.N. sanctions on Iraq went unnoticed in the sanctions committee of the Security Council." The Iranian envoy said the U.S. charges followed Iranian moves to increase coastal guard patrols to tightly control the implementation of the U.N. sanctions. But the U.S. official said the allegations were based on statistical data, confirmed by personal interviews with those involved, and other physical proof. Kharazi said he would offer the Security Council's sanctions committee "documents proving baselessness of the U.S. allegations against Iran". He did not elaborate. The U.N. imposed sanctions against Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
