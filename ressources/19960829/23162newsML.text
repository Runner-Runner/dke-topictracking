Indonesian department store operator PT Ramayana Lestari Sentosa said on Thursday it was confident it would meet its 1996 net profit target of 61.6 billion rupiah. Ramayana's finance director Setiasa Kusuma said that based on its first-half net profit of 33.9 billion rupiah and steady growth in sales during July and August, he believed the firm would be able to maintain its margins and achieve -- or even exceed -- its 1996 target. "I believe we can exceed the net profit target but we have no plans to revise up our target," Kusuma told Reuters. In the second half of 1996, Ramayana plans to open several new stores including two in Jakarta, one in Kuta, Bali, and one on Batam Island. A fifth has not yet been finalised. Kusuma said two of the stores which started operations this month in Pasar Tebet and Tanjung Priok, both in Jakarta, were performing better than expected. "We are optimistic about reaching our 1996 sales target of 850 billion rupiah," he added. Ramayana posted first-half sales of 433.9 billion rupiah this year, or a 41 percent increase from the same period in 1995. ($1 = 2,340 rupiah)
