Leading UK shares broke back below the 3,900 level as U.S. economic data raised the spectre of higher interest rates and traders took the chance to mark prices lower on Thursday, dealers said. The FTSE 100 had earlier climbed to 3,8921.1 just below it's record of 3,922.1, before edging down through the afternoon session to finish the day at 3,885.0, a fall of 33.7 points. The drop was the biggest fall since July 24, since when the index has risen nearly 250 points. Business was modest with thin market conditions and short positions continuing to exaggerate price movements.
