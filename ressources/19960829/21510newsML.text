Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto praised efforts to consolidate peace, democracy and development in Central America in a meeting with regional leaders during a three-hour stopover in Costa Rica on Wednesday. Hashimoto greeted four heads of state during his brief visit here as part of a five-nation tour of Latin America. "The Central American region has overcome the conflict of civil wars and the problems of external debt of the eighties and is achieving firm results both in the consolidation of peace and democracy and the structural economic reform aimed at creating a market economy," he said in a speech. Though no new infusion of Japanese aid to Central America was announced, the prime minister said more economic assistance to the region would be forthcoming. "(Japan and Central America) can in the future increase solidarity and cooperation in relations," he said. Hashimoto expressed interest in the peace talks advancing toward resolving Guatemala's 36-year civil war and Oct. 20 elections in Nicaragua, but fell short of pledging specific amounts of financial assistance to either effort. "Prime Minister Hashimoto said he would support the process of consolidating peace in Guatemala once a peace agreement has been reached," Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres said. The Guatemalan government and rebels are working toward signing a peace agreement by the end of the year. Figueres said that as a result of his half-hour meeting with Hashimoto, a team of Japanese experts would arrive in Costa Rica to evaluate a hydroelectric project for which Japan pledged a $200 million loan during Figueres's visit to Japan in May. Hashimoto also met with Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, Prime Minister of Belize Manuel Esquivel and high-ranking officials from El Salvador, Panama and Nicaragua. Costa Rica was the last stop in Hashimoto's Latin American trip that included Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru.
