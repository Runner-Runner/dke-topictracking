Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Thursday that new rules to enact planned reforms to pension funds would be unveiled by the end of August, enabling them to take part in Italy's forthcoming privatisations. "By the end of the month the Treasury Minister (Carlo Azeglio Ciampi) will present...rules regulating pension funds," Prodi said in an interview with Panorama magazine released ahead of publication. "It's more than a year since the (pensions) law was approved and finally we will make it fully operational. I am sure that the cabinet will have a swift response. The privatisations will go ahead with the pension funds. It's a task I have set myself." Former prime minister Lamberto Dini pushed through pension reforms last year after hard-fought negotiations with trades unions. They included measures aimed at an overhaul of Italy's under-developed private pension funds. Treasury undersecretary Laura Pennacchi said in July that elaboration of the measures, to be put in a treasury decree, was almost ready and that pension funds should be able to take part in the next wave of Italian privatisations. The government is planning to sell off state-controlled telecommunications monopoly Stet next spring. The privatisation of electricity group Enel is also due next year and the sale of a second tranche of energy company Eni is scheduled for this October. -- Rome newsroom +396 678 2501
