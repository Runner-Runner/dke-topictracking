Chinese Petroleum Corp on Thursday closed the second of two crude unloading units near its north Taiwan refinery, stalling unloading of a 250,000-tonne tanker for as long as "a few days", an executive said.   "Both units were closed after we found minor oil leakage in one undersea pipeline and a connection problem in the other," a company official told Reuters by telephone. An executive at Chinese Petroleum's headquarters in Taipei said by telephone that repairs could keep both units closed for "a few days", but said the shutdown would not seriously affect the firm's supplies or crude tendering schedules. "A delay of few days would not disrupt our supplies, nor affect prices," the official said. Officials reached at the offshore unloading facility near Chinese Petroleum's refinery at Taoyuan in northern Taiwan said the problem could be repaired in as little as one day.   Chinese Petroleum shut one of the unloading units on Wednesday after finding minor oil leaks. The second was shut down on Thursday due to problems in a pipeline connector, officials said without disclosing details about the problem. Unloading of a 250,000-tonne oil tanker, Sailor, was halted and the vessel moored nearby after the leak was discovered, a manager at the Taoyuan oil refinery said by telephone. Details of the tanker's registry and the source of its cargo were not immediately available. Officials could not say how much of its crude had been offloaded. The leak was controlled within an hour and cleanup crews were using chemical and enzymatic agents to break up the oil. "Only minor oil spills were reported," the manager said. Repairs were under way and the affected unit would reopen soon, he said. -- Taipei Newsroom (2-5080815)
