Dark northern spring wheat cash bids were weaker on Thursday, following a drop in MGE spring wheat futures, and farmer selling was light, several cash grain dealers said. "We're basically going down with the board," said one Montana dealer. "We're sinking with the ship." Montana bids were down three cents per bushel, in line with a 2-3/4 cents drop in MGE December wheat futures. But basis levels dropped five cents in some Minnesota locations as mill buying interest dried up ahead of the three-day holiday weekend, one dealer said. "The mills just weren't supporting that 40 (cents over the MGE December futures) number," the dealer said. "We're going into Labor Day Weekend and mills are pretty well stocked. People are expecting a pretty good run over the weekend."
