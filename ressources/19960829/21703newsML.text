Your kids' retirement probably is pretty far down on their list of priorities. Most people don't start thinking about retirement until they are far along in their careers. But you can do your kids a big favour by helping them set up Individual Retirement Accounts as soon as they are old enough to earn money. Consider this example from the Vanguard family of mutual funds: Say you set up an IRA for a 14-year-old who spent the summer mowing lawns and can set aside $500 of that money. Then, assume that money earns an average total return of 8 percent a year for the next 51 years. By the end of that period, the account will have grown to $25,300. Even after paying taxes on that money at a 28 percent rate, there would be $18,200. By contrast, if the child waits until age 29 to invest, he'll need to sock away more than three times as much to accumulate the same amount by age 65. Better yet, a child who starts saving now might continue the savings habit in the years to come. If he invests $500 a year from age 14 to age 29, he'll accumulate $234,000 by age 65 -- even if he never saves another nickel. The catch? The kid won't be able to get at his or her money until age 59-1/2 without paying significant early withdrawal penalties of 10 percent in addition to taxes due. If the child needs his or her money sooner, you have two alternatives. First, he or she can invest outside of an IRA. A $500 investment in a taxable account at age 14 will grow to around $12,000 (after taxes) at age 65, assuming the money is invested in a fund with an 8 percent rate of return. The second choice is better if you can swing it: Have the child invest his or her earnings in the IRA. (IRA contributions cannot exceed the lower of the child's earned income or $2,000.) It will be tied up there for decades to come -- but meanwhile you can help the kid out with a tax-free gift of cash. Another advantage of an IRA is that the money can be invested for the long-term, with little regard for short-term fluctuations in the account's value. Thus, you can choose aggressive funds that can deliver above-average long-term growth. For example, funds that buy shares of small, emerging growth companies often are volatile. But they generally outperform the average equity fund over long periods. Twentieth Century Ultra Investors (800-345-2021; $2,500 minimum investment; no-load) invests in small and mid-cap companies with accelerating earnings, and high-growth large-cap companies as well. Technology companies recently accounted for  almost half of the portfolio's holdings. Funds that invest in Latin America, Asia or other developing regions can share in the rapid growth of some developing countries. Vanguard International Equity Index Emerging Markets (800-662-7447; $3,000 minimum; no-load) invests 80 percent of its assets in an index composed of 12 emerging market countries, ranging from Thailand to Mexico. Finally, consider a fund that invests in neglected shares of smaller firms. Acorn (800-922-6769; $1,000 minimum; no-load) is a solid choice. It can also invest up to one-third in foreign securities.
