Leisure group Ladbroke edged five pence higher to 212p in pre-market trade after touching a new year high following better-than-expected first half profits.   The shares reached 215p after the group unveiled pre-tax profits before exceptional items up 29 percent to 72.8 million stg, versus analysts' forecasts of 65 million to 70 million. "The big gain was in cash betting," said UBS analyst Paul Heath. Retail betting profits in Europe rose to 32.5 million stg from 22.2 million on lower turnover of 884.8 million stg. Analysts also noted the positive outlook for the group's hotels business in the second half of the year. "With the hotels market around the world generally buoyant, Hilton International is expected to make good progress in the second half," said Ladbroke in its results statement.   Ladbroke also announced it has agreed with Hilton Hotels Corporation a worldwide alliance that includes the reunification of the Hilton hotel brand. "It looks a very sensible deal," said Heath. "It's basically along the lines we were hoping for." Analysts said they hoped to hear more about the cost benefits of the deal, which some have estimated could over the next two years lead to annual savings of around 50 million stg. The company said it was holding a presentation for analysts at 0830 GMT at the Langham Hilton in London. -- London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7717
