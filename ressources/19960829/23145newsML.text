A joint venture of Philippines' Ayala Land Inc and Hong Kong Land Holdings Ltd unveiled plans on Thursday to build the country's most expensive condominium project costing about 5.5 billion pesos in the financial district of Makati. The project, consisting of twin 53-storey towers, will be built on a 1.1-hectare property, an Ayala official said. Construction will start in October with the first phase completed in two and a half years' time. Pre-selling will start in November this year. The towers will have 369 units with state-of-the-art amenities and security features. "This is for a special niche market that we in fact have not yet tapped," Marivic Anonuevo, Ayala assistant vice president for project development, told reporters. Ayala Land president Francisco Licuanan said he believed that the units would be sold out immediately to local scions and top expatriates of foreign companies operating in the country. "This early, we already have a list of interested buyers," he added. An Ayala official said the units might be sold at around 80,000 to 100,000 pesos per square metre. The joint venture firm implementing the project, known as Roxas Land Inc, is 50 percent-owned by Ayala Land, 40 percent owned by Hong Kong Land and 10 percent owned by Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), the banking subsidiary of Ayala Corp . Hong Kong Land's executive director Michael Arnold said the joint venture is looking at other projects. "We see many medium-term opportunities for the property market to expand," he told Reuters, citing housing for the middle-income group south of Manila. Ayala Land, for its part, is launching three new mass-housing projects south of Manila, Licuanan said. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
