Shares in The Australian Gas light Co were fired up in early trading on Thursday, jumping over five percent to a record high of A$5.87 after the gas utility turned in a 32 percent higher full year net profit of A$124.3 million.   Underlining its change in focus to a broader revenue base, the company said nearly 40 percent of its annual profit came from non-gas businesses including electricity distribution. The company holds a 50 percent stake in Victorian electricity distributor Solaris Power. "It was a pleasing result and the market is showing it is pretty happy with it," said a Sydney broker. By 11.20 a.m. (0120 GMT), AGL shares had gone further ahead to up 32 cents at A$5.90 on turnover of 401,975 shares. --Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
