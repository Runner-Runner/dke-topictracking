Dutch biochemicals and food group Gist-Brocades NV said on Thursday it expected net profit for the full year 1996 to be clearly higher than in 1995.   "Assuming that there will be no excessive fluctuations in the major currencies, Gist-Brocades expects the net profit for the whole of 1996 to be distinctly higher than that for the whole of 1995," the company said in a statement. First-half profits rose by 8.2 percent to 69.7 million guilders and operating profit grew by 10 percent to 87.9 million. Turnover also increased by 10 percent to 980.8 million. Gist-Brocades said 76 million guilders of its 1995 first-half turnover related to activities which were sold later. About 90 million guilders of its current year's first-half turnover was caused by recent acquisitions.   "Organic growth in (first-half) turnover amounted to eight percent," the company said. It added that results at its Industrial Pharmaceuticals Products division were virtually unchanged but profitability at the Bakery Ingredients and Food Specialties divisions improved clearly in the first six months of 1996. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
