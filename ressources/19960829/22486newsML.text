Standard Chartered Plc jumped on Thursday as stock shortages squeezed shares to a record high in morning trading, dealers said. By 0952 GMT the stock was up 20-1/2p at 736 after earlier hitting a new peak of 740p. "It's just a short position in the market," said one trader. "Obviously the old bid rumours reappear after the move." Some cited activity in the options market as being behind the rise though others said this was "not exceptional".   Standard has long been the centre of bid speculation, although analysts say the need for a large goodwill write-off would be a significant deterrent to a potential predator. Standard Chartered has consistently repeated its belief that the bank has an excellent future as an independent company. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8712
