A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between rival Iraqi Kurdish groups in northern Iraq appeared to be holding on Thursday, a spokesman for the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said. "There were no reports of clashes and it looks as if it has been quiet," the spokesman told Reuters. The KDP's ceasefire with the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) went into effect at 8 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Wednesday. The ceasefire, brokered by U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau, replaced a previous ceasefire arrangement on Friday which was broken by sporadic fighting. Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since fighting broke out between the two groups in 1994. About 3,000 people died before a previous ceasefire last March. The region has been protected by a U.S.-led air force against possible attack from Baghdad since shortly after the Gulf War in 1991.
