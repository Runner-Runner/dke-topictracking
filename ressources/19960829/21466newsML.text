Mexico's interest rates could drop to lower levels in 1997 if the global economic picture remains favorable, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said in an interview with the newspaper Reforma. "I think that in 1997, if the world economic climate stays favorable, as we believe it will as there are no signs of recession or inflation in the United States, it could signify that interest rates could reach lower levels," Ortiz told the newspaper. Ortiz said that payments on the external debt will likely be $6.952 billion in 1996, the newspaper reported.   Ortiz told the newspaper that total public sector revenues have been substantially better than expected, and this was especially due to the price of petroleum. "What is very probable is that budgetary revenues for this year will be higher than what we expected in real and nominal terms," he told the newspaper. "We think that we will finish the year with a balanced budget, because of the better revenues, although certainly there will be increased payments for grain imports and for support to the financial system," the newspaper quoted him as saying. Ortiz said that net international reserves are very low, and that in a floating exchange regime the central bank will intervene infrequently to support the currency. "...still net reserves of about $15 to $20 billion would be better than to have four or five billion," he said. -- Mexico City newroom (525) 728 9559
