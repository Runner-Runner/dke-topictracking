Former Poland President Lech Walesa will visit Taiwan at the end of October for four days, his first trip to the island, the mass-circulation China Times newspaper reported on Thursday. Invited jointly by China Times and a leading industrial association Chinese National Federation of Industries, Walesa was scheduled to arrive in Taipei on October 31 and leave on November 3, the newspaper said. Walesa will give speeches in Taipei and the southern city of Kaohsiung, it said. The former Polish President will also visit parliament, the National Assembly and meet senior government officials and labour representatives, it said. Walesa, who in 1980 launched a long struggle by Poland's Solidarity trade union movement against communist rule, was voted out as the country's President last November after losing in a poll to ex-Communist Aleksander Kwasnieski. He has since returned to a $250 a month job as a shipyard electrician.
