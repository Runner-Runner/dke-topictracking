The main factor in this category boosting prices was an increase in the cost of package tours. Indices for rent and energy, and transportation and communication, rose, while the index for clothing and shoes was steady. Prices of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco products fell, mainly due to seasonal factors affecting fruit and vegetable prices. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340
