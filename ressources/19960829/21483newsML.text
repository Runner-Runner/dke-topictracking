Compania Cervecerias Unidas Chile is spending about $12 million to improve its distribution system, including with new computer software imported from the United States, the brewery said. The plans also include new, lighter trucks for more efficient stock delivery, CCU said in a statement. The new computer network is already in operation in Santiago and will start working in the Sixth Region, which includes Rancagua, next year, it said. --Roger Atwood, Santiago newsroom +56-2-699-5595 x211
