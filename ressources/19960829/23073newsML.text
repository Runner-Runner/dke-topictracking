RGC Ltd said on Thursday that greatly improved mineral sands demand and prices, together with a higher tin price and production helped boost operating profit for the year to June 30, 1996. RGC, which is 40 percent owned by British conglomerate Hanson Plc, reported a doubling of operating profit to A$108.57 million in 1995/96. RGC Mineral Sands' profit more than doubled to A$93.2 million on a record sales volume of almost 1.2 million tonnes of total products was achieved, RGC said in a statement accompanying its 1995/96 results.   RGC also reported an abnormals profit of A$81.04 million in 1995/96, which reflected the profit on the sale of the non-gold assets from Pancontinental Mining Ltd (Pancon). The RGC group took control of Pancon through a takeover bid last year. RGC said its positive cash flow from operating activities increased 63 percent to A$187 million in 1995/96. The Sydney-based group said increased tin output, reduced costs and an improved seling price combined to reduce the loss reported by its Renison mine in Tasmania to A$0.9 million. It said difficulties were encountered in achieving satisfactory processing plant recovery and concentrate grade.   RGC said its 75 percent owned Koba Tin, which operates the Koba tin mine in Indonesia, produced a 83 percent rise in profit contribution to A$8.7 million for 1995/96. Higher tin prices and tin output were partially offset by an increase in site costs arising mainly from the expansion of earthmoving operations for the Bemban project, it said. The Bemban dredge project involves the relocation of a large bucket ladder dredge from Malaysia to Bangka Island, Indonesia. RGC said profits from its 57 percent owned gold offshoot Goldfields Ltd were adversely affected by operational difficulties at mines in Western Australia and Papua New Guinea.   On Wednesday, Goldfields, which was formed from the gold assets of RGC and Pancon, reported a net profit of A$14.19 million in 1995/96, which was well short of the A$25 million to A$35 million forecast in its 1995 prospectus. RGC said financial hedging activity increased during the year, and with the strengthening of the Australian dollar, financial hedging profits increased significantly. At 1.40 p.m.(0340 GMT), RGC shares were three cents lower at A$5.90. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373 1800
