Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram may address the lower house of parliament on Friday about the government's proposed 1996/97 (April-March) budget, a ministry official said. His remarks would be part of a two-stage response to reports that standing committees from both houses of parliament have prepared this month on the budget, which Chidambaram presented to lawmakers in July. The finance minister will first offer a general reply, perhaps early on Friday afternoon, to the parliamentary reports. It would not be known before late Thursday afternoon whether Chidambaram would make his remarks on Friday or at a later date, the official said. He plans to make a more detailed reply on the finance bill, including offering any amendments to tax proposals, next month, probably on September 9 or 10, the official said. The budget is expected to come to a vote in parliament by September 13, when the current session is set to end. Newspapers have said Chidambaram is considering exempting certain sectors from the proposed minimum alternate tax (MAT) on corporations which was proposed in the budget. The Economic Times said on Thursday that the finance minister "has virtually made up his mind to grant tax relief to the steel industry". Finance Ministry officials declined to comment on the report. - New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
