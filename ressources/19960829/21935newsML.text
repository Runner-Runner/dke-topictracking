Two west German former allies of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, brought to east Germany after unification to become regional leaders of Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), went on trial on Thursday accused of fraud. Werner Muench, former premier of Saxony-Anhalt state, and his former social affairs minister Werner Schreiber are accused of giving false information about their previous salaries as members of parliament to boost their pay illegally. Salaries of politicians in east Germany were by law lower than those of their western colleagues at the time. But western politicians who showed they had earned more in their previous post were not expected to take a drop in pay and were entitled to go on receiving this amount. Saxony-Anhalt's entire state cabinet quit in 1993 after the regional audit office accused Schreiber, Muench and two other ministers brought in from the west of fraud to the tune of 900,000 marks ($600,000) by overstating their previous pay. Charges against two of the men were subsequently dropped. Muench and Schreiber told the court in the eastern city of Magdeburg that they had not meant to overstate their salaries as deputies in the European and federal parliaments respectively. Both men said Gerd Gies, Muench's predecessor as Saxony-Anhalt state premier, had invited them to come from the west to join his CDU cabinet after the party's election victory in 1990, and promised them western salaries. Muench told the court that these salary levels were also agreed with the chancellor's office in Bonn. A verdict is expected next week.
