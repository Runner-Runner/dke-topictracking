Security was tight outside a Jakarta court on Thursday as about 100 supporters of Indonesian democracy figurehead Megawati Sukarnoputri gathered ahead of her law suit brought against the government and party rivals. Witnesses said about 50 riot police, backed up by one armoured car and some police dogs, stopped supporters from entering the court complex after the courtroom filled up around 9.00 a.m. (0200 GMT). They said there was no immediate signs of protestors and traffic was flowing slowly but smoothly past the Central Jakarta State Court building on the main Jalan Gadjah Mada thoroughfare. Megawati's lawyers said on Wednesday they had failed to reach an out-of-court settlement with the government and political rivals. The case was adjourned August 22 when the judge asked the parties to explore the possibility of a settlement. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
