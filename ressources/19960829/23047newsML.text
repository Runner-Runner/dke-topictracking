Shareholders in New Zealand property development, construction and investment company Mainzeal Group on Thursday approved the company's proposed share placement and name change to Richina Pacific, the New Zealand Stock Exchange said.   The share placement is in connection with plans, endorsed by the shareholders, to build and operate a walkthrough underwater world aquarium in central Beijing. This will be a joint venture between Mainzeal (80 percent) and local Chinese investors. Shareholders approved the placement of 45 million shares at 32.4 cents per share to raise $14.6 million. Mainzeal will also proceed with a fully underwritten one for eight cash issue at 25 cents/share to raise $6.3 million. A prospectus will be issued on September 2 and rights trading will start the same day.   The name change to Richina Pacific Ltd takes effect on September 27. Mainzeal said all known Chinese regulatory consents for the aquarium have been received. Excavation is due to start on September 1, with the opening scheduled for July 1997. Feasibility studies show the underwater world will break even with 600,000 visitors in its first year but directors expect more than twice this number annually. Mainzeal shares closed on Thursday at NZ$0.35. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
