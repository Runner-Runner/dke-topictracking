Physical cocoa trading at Cargill in the Netherlands will not be affected by the closure of the company's operations in the United States, the president of its cocoa division Paul Lammers said on Thursday. "What we do here is not related. The U.S. is not offering any rewards but there are more participants here," he said. But he acknowledged that business for trading houses was getting tougher and that margins in general were being squeezed. "Over the last 10 years or so, the cooca trade has dwindled. I don't think there is any cocoa trading firm that has posted spectacular results in this period," he told Reuters. On Wednesday, Cargill Inc, one of the world's largest physical cocoa players, announced it was quitting the business in the United States as it was unable to realise sufficient returns there. Its physical cocoa units in other parts of the world would remain in the business, it added. In the Netherlands, Cargill's cocoa operations are divided between the grinding plants of Gerkens Cacao Industrie BV and the trading arm of General Cocoa. Lammers confirmed that Cargill's Amsterdam-based trading operations would be moved to the same location as the processing plant at Wormer, around 25 kilometres north of the capital. The move is scheduled for November and involves no job losses, Lammser stressed and the two separate divisions of Gerkens and General Cocoa would remain firmly in place. --David Evans, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000
