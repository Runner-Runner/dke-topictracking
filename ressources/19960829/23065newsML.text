Australia said on Thursday it accepted an aid agency's report that six Roman Catholic missionaries, including three Australian nuns, had been freed by Sudanese rebels who held them captive for almost two weeks. "We are fairly confident that's the situation," an Australian foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters here. Earlier, a Norwegian People's Aid official in east Africa said the three nuns, an American priest, an Italian brother and a Sudanese priest were released on Wednesday. But church sources in the region have yet to confirm the report. The missionaries were taken captive by Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) rebels in the southern village of Mapourdit on August 17. The rebels had accused four of the group of being spies and agents of Islam after reportedly finding a quotation from the Koran on a bookmark in a Bible belonging to the nuns. The SPLA has fought Khartoum's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem north. "I understand all of them are fine. They are obviously a bit tired and anxious but otherwise fine," Graham Wood, acting Sudan director of the Norwegian aid group, told Reuters on Wednesday. Australia's foreign ministry said the aid group's information had been very reliable in the past. A plane is due, weather permitting, to evacuate the six on Thursday, it said. Believed released are Sisters Moira Lynch, 73, Mary Batchelor, 68, and Maureen Carey, 52, American Father Michael Barton, 48, Sudanese Father Raphael Riel, 48, and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella, 28.
