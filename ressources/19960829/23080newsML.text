The ruling National Party's coalition partner United New Zealand on Thursday released its party list of candidates for the October 12 election. Leader Clive Matthewson heads the list which has the six sitting MPs who are seeking re-election in the top six places. Deputy leader and former National Cabinet minister Bruce Cliffe is stepping down at the election. The top ten places in order are Matthewson, former Labour Cabinet minister Margaret Austin, Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne, Papakura MP John Robertson, Wellington Central MP Pauline Gardiner, Glenfield MP Peter Hilt, manager Diane Colson,   lawyer Ted Faleauto, physiotherapist Malcolm Hood and deputy school principal Ramparkash Samujh. United has named only 28 list candidates. Polls in Dunne's Ohariu-Belmont electorate indicate he has a good chance of being re-elected, but nationally the United Party is rating about one percent in the opinion polls. Parties which fail to win one of the 65 constituency seats must register five percent support to qualify for party list seats in the election set down for October 12. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
