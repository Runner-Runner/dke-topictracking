Manitoba Agriculture Minister Harry Enns will lead a group of Canadian hog processors, pork exporters and a Canadian bank on a tour of Pacific Rim nations seeking investment capital to boost exports to that region. "Asia is a prime source of investment capital and export sales to fuel the growth of our pork industry," Enns said in a statement. Enns, hog processor Schneider Corp, exporter Manitoba Pork,  Manstock International Ltd and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce leave Sunday for Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. Japan is the world's largest net importer at 9.6 million hogs a year. Many in the Canadian trade consider South Korea and Taiwan as having much growth potential. Hong Kong demand for Canadian pork was largely expected to be steady. Manitoba saw the largest growth in hog output of any Canadian province in calendar 1995 with a total production of 2.6 million swine and exported 70 percent of them. The provincial government eliminated Manitoba Pork's export monopoly July 1 with a view to encouraging more production and Enns has said output could double by 2000. -- Gilbert Le Gras 204 947 3548
