Shares in the United Arab Emirates remained static in the week to Thursday, but trading volumes improved slightly as the gap between bids and offers narrowed, brokers said. They said Dubai Investment Co, Etisalat and Dubai Islamic Bank were traded in small volumes at last week's prices. The 209 million dirham public offering of shares in the new Al-Khazna Insurance firm remained the centre of attraction for most market players. But brokers said share prices were steady despite some sales of recently-acquired stocks by small investors to buy into the new flotation. The unofficial National Bank of Abu Dhabi 27-share index ended the week unchanged at 2,333.02 points. -- Dubai Newsroom  9714-626990
