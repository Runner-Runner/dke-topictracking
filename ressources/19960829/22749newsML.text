Charges for analogue (TAC) mobile phones operated by Telecom Italia Mobile will be revised, the under-secretary at the Post and Telecommunications Ministry announced on Thursday. Michele Lauria told a consumer watchdog association that the introduction of new TIM contracts in September would bring reductions of between 8.0 to 7.0 (corrects from "between 1.8 to 7.0") percent on TAC users' bills. Tariff revisions for fixed line telephones run by Telecom Italia have already been announced for next month. TIM is the only operator in Italy to offer TAC mobile phones. The country's second cellular phone company, Omnitel, only has a licence to operate the digital GSM system. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501
