Wiz Technology Inc said on Thursday that its independent auditor, Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., resigned as of August 21. The resignation did not stem from "any disagreements with the auditing firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures," said Mar-Jeanne Tendler, Wiz chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. The company said it has conducted interviews with officials of other major auditing firms in recent days and expected to hire one of them soon. Wiz Technologies shares were off 14/16 to 4-9/16 Thursday afternoon.
