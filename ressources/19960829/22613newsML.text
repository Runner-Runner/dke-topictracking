HFS Inc. said Thursday it has a definitive agreement to acquire General Motors Corp.'s 29 percent equity stake in Avis Inc. The deal follows definitive agreements reached last week with the Avis Employee Stock Ownership Trust and Avis Inc. to purchase the company for $800 million. The car rental company is 71 percent owned by employees. The previously announced purchase is expected to close in October, subject to a vote by employee participants in the Avis Employee Stock Ownership Plan in late September, regulatory approval and completion of fleet financing. HFS has said that it may acquire another car rental company and spin off a majority stake in that business in 1997. Parsippany, N.J.-based HFS is the world's largest franchisor of hotels and residential real estate brokerage offices. The company has nearly 5,300 Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Knights Inn, Park Inn, Ramada, Super 8, Travelodge, Villager Lodge and Wingate Inn franchised hotels in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Europe. In real estate, HFS' CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker and ERA brands have about 11,200 franchised offices with more than 160,000 brokers and agents in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Puerto Rico, Europe, Africa and the Asia/Pacific region. GM's stock fell 12.5 cents to $49.625, while HFS rose 75 cents to $62.125 early on the New York Stock Exchange.
