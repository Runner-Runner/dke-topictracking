Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) chairman Tajudin Ramli has received government approval to bid for a company which manages Malaysia's airport facilities, the Asian Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Quoting executives familiar with the plan, the business daily said Tajudin-controlled Malaysian Helicopter Services Bhd received the go-ahead three weeks ago to submit a proposal to acquire Malaysia Airports Bhd under the country's privatisation programme. An MAS spokesman said he had no immediate comment while Malaysia Airports could not be immediately reached. Malaysia Airports is a profitable state-owned company and is constructing the nine billion ringgit new Kuala Lumpur international airport. Tajudin controls MAS after the government sold its 32 percent stake in the carrier to him in a 1.79 billion ringgit deal signed in June last year.   The newspaper said there were hurdles to Tajudin's plan to take over Malaysia Airports, including whether he would have to service the debt incurred by the new Kuala Lumpur airport. Malaysia Airport senior management also oppose the plan and have asked the government that they be allowed to mount a management buoyout bid, the AWSJ said.
