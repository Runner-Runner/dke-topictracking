China said on Thursday that the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) had underestimated its cotton production and that output in 1996/1997 would be at least 4.35 million tonnes. "The ICAC always underestimates our output by 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes," an official of the China Textile Cotton Import and Export Corp said. "Output in 1996 and 1997 will not be lower than 4.35 million tonnes," he said. The ICAC lowered on Wednesday its forecast for China's 1996/1997 cotton output to 3.7 million tonnes from 4.1 million tonnes. The advisory group said it was basing its forecast on 4.4 million hectares planted and cautioned that the estimate could be revised again. The ICAC also said that lower production would not have much impact on imports over the near term because of substantial stocks and the time required for decision-making on purchases. The Chinese official said that domestic supplies exceeded demand. Inventories were high due to a bumper harvest in 1995 and sluggish consumption, he said. China will lose its position as the world's largest cotton producer to the United States if its production declines and the U.S. harvest matches the 4.1 million tonnes forecast by the U.S. Agriculture Department. China's 1995/1996 cotton crop was 4.8 million tonnes, according to the ICAC. Chinese farmers normally plant cotton in April and May and harvest in August and September.
