The Philippine Central Bank said on Thursday it would cut its rediscount rate for September to 11.029 percent from August's 11.331 percent.   The rediscount rate is adjusted monthly, set at one percentage point below the average 91-day Treasury bill rate. The 91-day bills fetched 12.029 percent at the last auction of government securities on Monday. The rediscount window is open to all banks which then relend the funds to small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and exporters at a slight premium. Total funds lent through the rediscounting window reached 3.647 billion pesos from the start of 1996 to August 27, the Central Bank said in a statement. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
