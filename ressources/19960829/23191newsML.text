French securities firm BNP Securities Japan, the securities arm of Banque Nationale de Paris, plans to nearly double its Tokyo staff by the year 2000, the BNP Group representative in Japan said Thursday. The increased staffing, which will bring the number of employees to 80 from the current 47, will begin in 1997 and take around three years, Jean-Francois Ledoux said. The main emphasis will be on increasing the group's presence in derivatives, particularly equities derivatives, although the group also intends to expand in the areas of cash equities and other securities trade, he added. As part of this expansion, Ledoux said the company was also considering buying a seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. "This is more part of development in Asia. It is not a choice between Hong Kong or Singapore and Tokyo at all," he added. Another French bank, Societe Generale, announced in July that it was expanding its foreign exchange operations in Tokyo, partly as a result of the yen's depreciation against the dollar and rising business costs in places like Singapore.
