The Philippine government and Moslem separatist negotiators started their final round of talks on Thursday with hopes of ending a bloody 24-year rebellion in the south of the country. We face the final day of our long journey towards peace, government delegation chief Manuel Yan told the opening ceremony. By the end of this day ... an historic document shall have emerged from our hearts and minds, he said. Delegates will discuss the final draft of a peace agreement that will be initialled in front of Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta on Friday, and formally signed in Manila on Monday. The chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), Nur Misuari, said: Surely, we are now on the threshold of...a just, comprehensive, honourable and lasting peace. The opening ceremony was chaired by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas who praised the participants for their efforts to achieve peace in the southern Philippines where 125,000 people have died since the separatist revolt broke out in 1972. The final peace negotiations opened on Wednesday and technical committees worked into early Thursday morning to settle details of the integration of Moslem guerrillas into the Philippines armed forces and into a regional security force in southern Mindanao province. Asked if there had been agreement on the integration process, Yan told Reuters: Oh yes, definitely. Indonesia has chaired a six-nation ministerial committee from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference that has brokered the peace talks to end the revolt. The five million Moslems on Mindanao regard the area as their ancestral homeland, although they are now outnumbered three-to-one by Christian migrants. Christian politicians and their followers have vowed to fight the peace deal, which involves a three-year interim Council for Peace and Development followed in 1999 by a plebiscite leading to an autonomous regional government.
