Poland wants to tighten economic ties with fast-growing Southeast Asian countries at next week's Warsaw conference aimed at boosting bilateral investment and trade, the Polish trade minister said on Thursday. "Trade with Southeast Asia is very important to us...the region is Poland's second largest trading partner after Europe and it could surpass Europe in the next several years," Jacek Buchacz told a news conference. Buchacz said in the last 15 years the share of Southeast Asian countries in Polish trade doubled from 13 to 26 percent, but that Poland ran a trade deficit with the region. "Through this economic forum, we aim to help small and medium-size firms and promote Poland as an economic partner for Southeast Asia," Buchacz said. The First Economic Forum Poland-South East Asia, will gather government officials and industry leaders from 15 countries on September 3-4. Delegates from Hong Kong, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand will attend as well as representatives from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United Nations Development Organisation (UNIDO). Observers from China, Japan, South Korea, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia will be present. Poland had a $76 million deficit with ASEAN countries in the first five months of this year, but bilateral trade grew by over 50 percent from the same period of 1995 to $411 million.
