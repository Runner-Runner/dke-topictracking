Irish government bonds held Wednesday's price levels in steady late afternoon trade on Thursday as an unexpected jump in new U.S. home sales in July pointed to a strong economy, dealers said. "Trade has been reasonably steady all day. All bond papers are at or slightly below Wednesday's levels. The shorts are showing better tone. Peripheral European markets like Denmark seem to be under-performing a little," one dealer said. By 1520 GMT the eight percent bond due 2000 was down one penny at 103.63 to yield 6.83 percent. The eight percent bond due 2006 was back five pence to 102.63 to yield 7.48 percent.   "The long bond is pretty weak in the U.S. where there may be further declines in price levels," one dealer said. In the UK, gilt futures ended slightly higher on Wednesday's close after shrugging off the negative tone in the U.S. Treasuries which were hit by strong upward revision to Q2 GDP. In the U.S. July single-family home sales rose 7.3 percent to an annual rate of 783,000 units. The average sale price of a house cimbed to $143,000, the highest ever recorded, dealers said. --Senan Hogan, Dublin Newsroom +353 1 660 3377
