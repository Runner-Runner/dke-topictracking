U.S. Plains cattle markets were moderately active Thursday, with sales at $69.00 per cwt, up $1.00 from the bulk of last week's record-breaking volume, feedlot sources said. One load of extra-high quality steers also sold at $70.00 in the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma area. About 32,000 head traded in the Panhandle area Thursday and about 25,000 in Kansas, cattle feeders said. Despite the higher prices, there still were a number of feedlots that passed packer bids at $69.00 and continued to hold out for $70.00, they said.   Many feedlots were current in their marketings following last week's record big volume and had a large number of short-fed cattle on this week's showlists. Feedlot prices also were underpinned by moderate retail demand for boxed beef as packer discounted wholesale prices to move inventory before the three-day Labor Day holiday weekend. The activity spurred ideas that retailers would continue to feature beef after the holiday because it still was competitively priced to pork, market sources said. --Bob Janis 312-408-8720--
