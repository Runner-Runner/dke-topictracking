The resignation of Bill Clinton's high-profile strategist Dick Morris on Thursday means the president's true liberal colours will come out again, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole said. "Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican, now maybe he'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he (Clinton) really is," Dole told reporters. Dole said he did not know if the resignation would have a negative impact on the president's campaign. When asked if there would be an advantage to the Dole campaign, the former Kansas senator would only say: "I've already told you all I'm going to say." Dole spoke to reporters after being interviewed for a television special with ABC's Barbara Walters. The former Kansas senator is on vacation here, but has made a few political appearances. Clinton was scheduled to make his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Thursday, but all attention has focused on a published report in the New York Post that Morris had spent time with a prostitute whom he allowed to be in the room when Morris spoke on the telephone with the president.
