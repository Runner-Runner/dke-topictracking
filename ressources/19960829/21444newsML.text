About 50 Venezuelan police fired plastic bullets and tear gas on Thursday to disperse a small march by union workers, but no major injuries were reported, witnesses said. It was the most violent incident in the capital since the government launched a tough economic program four months ago. Police intervened when about 150 public sector workers, including firemen and health workers, blocked a main highway to protest delayed salary bonuses. Witnesses said at least five protesters were slightly injured during the clashes which lasted about an hour. The protest march followed a 24-hour work stoppage by about one million public sector workers on Wednesday. Union leaders condemned the violence, the most serious since the government began an austerity program which has seen the annual inflation rate rocket to more than 112 percent.
