Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust (KEPIT) on Thursday told shareholders why it had recommended rejecting the latest bid by TR European Growth Trust (TREG). In a letter to KEPIT shareholders, its chairman Shane Ross said the value of the TREG offers was uncertain, the offers could result in the portfolio being disposed of at depressed prices and they would involve substantial costs for shareholders and warrantholders. "The independent directors are working as fast as practicable to progress the most attractive proposals for KEPIT shareholders and warrantholders. These will be announced when the review process is complete," he said. Ross said the directors strongly advised shareholders not to accept the TREG offers for the 500 million stg trust, adding the directors did not intend accepting them "in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings". -- Alexander Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7719
