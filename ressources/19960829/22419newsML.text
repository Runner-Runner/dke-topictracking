UK estate agency and financial products group Hambro Countrywide said on Thursday it would perform even better in the second half of the year than it had in the first, which saw it return to profitability. "The housing market is slowly strengthening and we are taking a larger market share," Harry Hill, Hambro Countrywide's group managing director told Reuters in an interview. Earlier the group reported pre-tax profits of 10.5 million stg for the first half of the year, compared with a loss of 5.8 million stg for the same period the previous year.
