Lufthansa Cargo AG said it carried today Thursday its heaviest ever item of cargo on a Boeing 747 freighter from Frankfurt to Chicago. The Deutsche Lufthansa AG cargo arm said the cargo load was a 48.5 tonne electrical motor destined for a Siemens AG pipeline project in Canada. Together with transport equipment and pallet, the load weighed a total of 51 tonnes. The motor was 6.43 metres long, 3.3 metres wide and 2.3 metres high, a LCAG statement said. Siemens engineers, Lufthansa Cargo and Boeing spent three months preparing the transport, which involved partly dismantling the motor to get it inside the aircraft, it added. The motor was trucked on a special transporter from the Siemens dynamo plant in Berlin to Frankfurt and will be trucked from Chicago to the pipeline compressor station in Regina, Canada, it said. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44-171-542-7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017=
