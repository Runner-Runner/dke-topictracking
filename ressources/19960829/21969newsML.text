The Swiss Bourse intends to initiate new rules on Monday September 2 to minimise the incidence of broad share price swings resulting from erroneous order input, Otto Naegeli, head of marketing at the Swiss Exchange, said. Confirming a report in Finanz und Wirtschaft newspaper, he told Reuters trading in a stock would be halted after a price swing of 0.75 percent from one trade to another in the case of blue chips and 2.0 percent for other shares and government bonds. At present an errant order can cause a considerable move up or down before trading in a share is halted. The electronic system, in use since August 2, halts trading in a share only after a price swing of more than five percent. In future the first paid price in an order will be used as the reference. As soon as a price move within the same order exceeds the spread limit a stop would set in. Halts in options trading will be sparked by one percent price moves, Naegeli also said. -- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340
