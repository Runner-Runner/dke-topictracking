Turkey and Cuba on Thursday signed an agreement to strengthen trade, economic and industrial links, the state-run Anatolian news agency reported. The accord was signed at an international trade fair in Turkey's western port city of Izmir by senior trade officials, the agency said. Both countries agreed to grant most-favoured-nation status under the agreement covering trade, banking, transport, communication, agriculture and energy cooperation. Turkey's exports to Cuba in 1995 amounted to just $6.2 million.
