U.S. mortgage-backed securities slipped about a third of a point in discount coupons after robust Thursday morning economic reports. Premium coupon prices held up better, dipping three to five ticks by late afternoon. A large bid list, said to be a $350 million offering from a West Coast firm, was the market's focus early in the session, according to traders. "There was a little bit of mortgage-banker selling this morning, but nothing out of the ordinary," one trader said.   Late Thursday afternoon, Ginnie Mae 30-year 8.0 percent coupons were off 6/32 at 100-14/32, yielding 117 basis points over 10-year Treasuries. Comparable FNMAs were off 7/32 at 100-11/32, and FHLMCs were off 6/32 at 100-14/32. The market headed lower after a revised estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product put growth at 4.8 percent, up from 4.2 percent. "It implies a stronger third quarter than probably the 2.5 percent the consensus is looking for," said Carey Leahey, senior financial markets economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. --Scott Gerlach, 212-859-1868
