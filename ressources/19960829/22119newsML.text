Calvin Klein Jeanswear Co, a unit of Designer Holdings Ltd, said on Thursday it has filed a lawsuit in federal court against Conway Stores Inc for improperly selling flawed Calvin Klein merchandise. Conway agreed to stop selling second quality Calvin Klein Jeans pending a review by Designer Holdings of the quality of Conway's merchandise, Calvin Klein Jeanswear said. In its lawsuit, Calvin Klein Jeanswear claims that Conway is selling irregular goods as top quality Calvin Klein merchandise, the company said. New York City-based Conway Stores was not immediately available for comment. Designer Holdings develops, sources and markets sportswear under the Calvin Klein brand.
