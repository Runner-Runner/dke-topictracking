Dutch central bank chief Wim Duisenberg said on Thursday the European Union had come a long way towards securing stable inflation and exchange rates but public finances were still in disarray. "The red lights are still flashing for most countries," Duisenberg, the designated president of the future European Central Bank, told a conference on European issues in this mountain village near Innsbruck. The Dutch central bank president noted that according to the Maastricht criteria, only Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg would at present qualify for entry into Europe's planned monetary union scheduled to begin in 1999. "The others will have to slim down further in order to appear in good shape at the start of EMU (economic and monetary union)," he said. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 has laid down strict entry requirements in terms of inflation, deficit and debt levels for any country wanting to join the single currency. "I count on Austria and the Netherlands to succeed in qualifying for EMU," Duisenberg said. "Considerable efforts are required, but indications are that Austria and the Netherlands could pass the EMU fitness test." Duisenberg, addressing a high-level forum of bankers, businessmen and academics, reiterated calls for a so-called stability pact to prevent member countries from running up excessive deficits once they have joined the single currency. He said it was a matter of sound policy to strive for a balanced budget under normal circumstances so that automatic stabilisers could work in times of economic difficulties. "To me, the stability pact has great appeal," he said.
