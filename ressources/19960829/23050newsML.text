TransAlta NZ will issue shares, capital notes and bonds to shareholders of EnergyDirect and Capital Power as part of the merger of the two energy companies, TransAlta Chairman Ron Arbuckle said on Thursday. For every 1,000 EnergyDirect shares, shareholders would receive 1,000 TransAlta NZ shares plus $500 in capital notes, $500 in seven year bonds and $500 in 10 year bonds. TransAlta Corp owns 41 percent of EnergyDirect and all of Capital Power. It will hold 63 percent of TransAlta NZ, the new company to be formed by the merger.   Arbuckle said the issue of notes and bonds as well as shares was designed to create a flexible and efficient capital structure. The capital notes can be converted to shares or, if the funds are not needed, can be redeemed and the resulting cash returned to shareholders. Capital notes and bonds pay interest to holders every six months at rates to be set on September 27 based on market rates at that time.   TransAlta NZ has applied to the New Zealand Stock Exchange to have the notes quoted, and the bonds are expected to be tradeable through brokers. Arbuckle said an independent appraisal by Price Waterhouse "concluded that the merger proposal was not only fair to EnergyDirect's independent shareholders, but represents the best strategic option". Savings of some $123 million were expected to be gained over time from the merger by introducing efficiencies and cutting out duplication of computer systems, sales offices, head offices, senior management, board of directors and support staff.   Capital Power serves the Wellington region, while EnergyDirect is based in the nearby Hutt Valley. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
