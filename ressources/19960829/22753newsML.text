Worker councils representing ground staff at Swissair AG on Thursday said they unequivocally rejected management proposal to cut salaries by five percent across the board. A statement from three personnel unions and worker councils representing 7,700 Swissair ground staff said shorter working hours, which would improve employment, was preferred. Union representatives and Swissair management, led by chief operating officer Philippe Bruggisser, met earlier today and unions will consider their response next Monday. At the meeting Bruggisser modified Swissair's position and told the worker representatives that a five percent cut was not mandatory, but managment would insist on carrying out savings of 30 million Swiss francs. A Swissair spokesman confirmed Bruggisser's views. On July 30 Bruggisser told Swissair's staff magazine that he would beging talks with worker councils with the aim of lowering personnel costs by five percent in 1997. The savings are part of Swissair's overall target of cutting personnel costs by five percent, or some 100 million francs. Swissair is working on improving its bottom line by 500 million francs by 1998, including 100 million in personnel cost that also will be achieved by reducing jobs. The protest over management's proposal reflects the growing dissatisfaction among ground staff, which has seen productivity increase dramatically, unions said. The unions noted staffing had been cut by 18 percent since 1991 while revenue tonne-kilometres -- a measure of an airlines production -- had risen more than 40 percent. -- Peter Nielsen, Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340
