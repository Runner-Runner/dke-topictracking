The Bank of France said on Thursday it was leaving its intervention rate unchanged at 3.35 percent at a money market tender. A cut had not been expected, notably with the franc back under pressure. The Bank continued to post its five-to-10 day rate at 4.75 percent. The intervention rate, at which the central bank allocates repo funds, was last cut -- from 3.55 percent -- on August 22, 1996. On August 1, the Bank cut 15 basis points off its five-to-10 day rate from 4.90 percent. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
