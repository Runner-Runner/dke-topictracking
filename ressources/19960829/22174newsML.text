U.S. Treasuries closed lower for the second day in a row after a slew of fresh economic data renewed fears of a possible rate rise by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year, analysts said. The 6-3/4 percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond ended down 23/32 at 97-12/32. Its yield jumped to 7.04 percent, the highest level since the close on July 30.
