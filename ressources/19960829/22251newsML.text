Cincinnati Bell said on Thursday it has signed agreements with DIRECTV Inc and U.S Satellite Broadcasting to market the DIRECTV and USSB satellite television entertainment services and digital satellite system (DSS) equipment in greater Cincinnati. DIRECTV is a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp. Cincinnati Bell said that it will offer the services through its new entertainment business called CBTV.   The company said the package features more than 200 channels of DIRECTV and USSB programming including movies, sports, news and pay-per-view events. Consumers will receive DSS equipment consisting of an 18-inch satellite dish, set-top box and a remote control. The DSS systems are available for $249 after a $200 cash-back offer from DIRECTV, the company said.
