Shanghai rice futures ended up on Thursday, on institutional support late in the session, traders said. The key September 1996 contract ended at an intra-day high of 2,572 yuan ($309) per tonne, rising 62 yuan. It opened at 2,510 and hit a low of 2,508. October rose 35 to 2,540 yuan per tonne. Combined volume rose to 6,100 tonnes from 5,750. "Institutional support was responsible for today's sharp rises and rice will rise further if it can remain steady above 2,540/50 tomorrow," one trader said.   Traders said a lack of selling pressure at high levels made it easy for institutions to push up the price, but it is likely to meet profit-taking pressure over the next few days.
