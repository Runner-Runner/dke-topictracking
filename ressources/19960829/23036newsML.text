Australian Finance Minister John Fahey said the government, determined to get its finances into surplus, would look again at its fiscal plans if it failed to get some of its budget measures through parliament. "We have of course a strategy to reduce that deficit and get back into balance by 1988/89 -- a small (positive) balance of A$900 million," Fahey told a business function. "And if we do lose some in the Senate then I guess we are going to have to go back to the drawing board because we are very, very determined to ensure that again in this period of economic growth that we get back into balance."   In its August 20 budget the government announced budget savings worth A$3.9 billion in the current fiscal year, to June, A$7.2 billion in 1997/98 and A$7.0 billion in 1998/99. The measures are supposed to reduce the deficits expected in 1996/97 and 1997/98 and produce a A$957 million surplus in 1998/99. But many of the measures require legislation, which would have to passed by the upper house of parliament, the Senate, as well as the government-controlled House of Representatives.   Since the conservative government is two votes short of a majority in the Senate, and almost all other senators lean to the Left, some measures are not expected to survive. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
