India's election commission on Thursday set the timetable for elections to the legislature of the country's most populous state, a race that could be pivotal for the central government led by H.D. Deve Gowda. Election Commissioner Gali Krishnamurthy told reporters that polls to the 425-seat Uttar Pradesh assembly would be held in three phases on September 30 and October 3 and 7. Prime Minister Deve Gowda has campaigned strenuously in the state for his United Front allies against the Congress Party of former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. Deve Gowda, sworn in at the head of a minority alliance in June, needs Rao's support to survive in the federal parliament, where his main foe is the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). But both the BJP and Rao's Congress are ranged against Deve Gowda in the state polls. The Congress, once a dominant force in the state, has faced successive defeats there since 1989, variously at the hands of the BJP and an alliance of low caste Hindu leftists. The state was put under New Delhi's direct rule by Rao's government after a leftist-led coalition collapsed. The year-long federal rule in the state ends on October 17 this year. Assembly elections must be held before that. Seven of 10 Indian prime ministers have come from Uttar Pradesh, which according to the 1991 census had a population of 140 million of India's total population of over 920 million. Uttar Pradesh is also home to the town of Ayodhya, the site of a disputed mosque which has stirred Hindu-Moslem passions and a wave of religious fervour that fuelled the BJP's popularity. The BJP cornered nearly 35 percent of the vote in the state in this year's parliamentary elections. Rao had earlier dismissed a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh following the demolition of the Babri mosque by a Hindu mob in December 1992.
