Britain's Ladbroke Group Plc and Hilton Hotels Corporation of the U.S. have agreed a worldwide alliance that includes the reunification of the Hilton hotel brand, Ladbroke said on Thursday. Hilton Hotels Corp is the owner of the Hilton name within the U.S. and Ladbroke holds the rights to it elsewhere through its Hilton International subsidiary.   The announcement came as Ladbroke reported interim profit before tax and exceptional items of 72.8 million pounds ($113.4 million), up 29 percent on the first six months of 1995. Under the terms of an outline agreement, Hilton Hotels Corp and Hilton International will from 1997 cooperate on sales and marketing, loyalty programmes, hotel development and other operational matters. Hilton Hotels plans to take a five percent stake in Ladbroke once the agreement is finalised. Hilton, one of the most famous brands in the hotel world, has been operated separately outside the U.S. since 1964 when Hilton International was spun off. Ladbroke acquired Hilton International in 1987.
