Summit Bancorp and B.M.J. Financial Corp said on Thursday that they have entered a definitive merger agreement in which Summit will acquire B.M.J. in a tax-free exchange of stock. Under the agreement, each share of B.M.J. Financial stock will be exchanged for 0.56 of a share of Summit stock. Summit will receive an option to purchase up to 19.9 percent of B.M.J. Financial's common stock under certain conditions. The deal is valued at about $164.5 million or $21.77 for each B.M.J. Financial share, based on Summit's closing stock price of $38.875 on Wednesday.   The agreement allows for B.M.J. Financial to declare quarterly common dividends until the closing date in the same amount of dividend rate declared by Summit Bancorp. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 1997, subject to B.M.J. Financial shareholder and regulatory approvals. The deal is expected to be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Summit chairman T. Joseph Semrod said, "This acquisition will enhance Summit's presence in key central and southern New Jersey counties comprising nearly 5,000 businesses and half a million households."
