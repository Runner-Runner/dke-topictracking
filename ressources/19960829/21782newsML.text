Sex sells. But now, thanks to the "Foxy Lady Bill", it will be a little harder to sell it in Massachusetts. In a measure recalling the state's Puritan past, Massachusetts Gov. William Weld Thursday signed into law a bill allowing cities and towns further to regulate the zoning of adult entertainment establishments. "This law gives communities...the best possible shield against sex shops setting up next to a school or bus stop or retirement home," Weld said at the signing ceremony. The bill, sparked by an attempt to open a strip club called the Foxy Lady in Weymouth, a small city southeast of Boston, will allow municipalities to confine nude-dancing clubs to specially zoned areas.
