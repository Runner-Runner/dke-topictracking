French union leader Marc Blondel said on Thursday he expected social conflicts in the autumn because there was much discontent in the country. But the Force Ouvriere leader warned he feared such a social movement could be out of the hands of the unions. "It's my problem as a unionist that this risks to happen outside the control of the unions. More a sort of 'Poujadism'," Blondel told RTL radio, refering to a popular political uprising led by grocer Jean-Pierre Poujade in the 1950s.
