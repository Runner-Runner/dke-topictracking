Kunshan Sanshan Industry and Commerce Co Ltd said on Thursday that it posted a net loss of 13.44 million yuan in the first half of 1996 compared to net earnings of 4.83 million yuan in the same period last year. In its interim report published in the Securities Times, the Shenzhen-listed chemical fibre producer said that under Chinese accounting standards, it incurred a loss of 0.1005 yuan per share versus per share earnings of 0.0397 yuan in the first half of 1995. Main operating income plunged to 21.13 million yuan from 69.51 million yuan. Jiangsu-based Sanshan said the loss was due to the overall sluggishness of the country's chemical fibre market and falling sale prices. A company spokesman told the China Securities Bulletin the firm is planning to diversify operations this year in a bid to minimise the impact of weakening demand for chemical fibre, but he provided no details of the plan. Sanshan had reported a loss of 14.29 million yuan for the whole of 1995, compared with net earnings of 18.42 million yuan in 1994. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6441
