Regional bank Adelaide Bank Ltd said on Thursday it was well placed for the future and that it had strategies in place to grow in both its home state of South Australia and other states.  Adelaide Bank earlier announced a 23.9 percent rise in net profit to A$26.02 million for the year to June 30, 1996. The bank said it had the infrastructure in place through technology, a streamlined branch network, state-of-the-art and electronic banking to further develop its franchise in South Australia and business outside the state. "To optimise growth potential, Adelaide Bank now needs to see an economic resurgence both in South Australia and throughout the nation," it said. It said it cut its cost ratios in 1995/96, with the expense to income ratio falling to 60.21 percent from 63.16 percent.
