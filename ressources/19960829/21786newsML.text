CME lumber futures posted a new contract high in September following a bullish new single-family home sales report but closed lower on profit taking, traders said. September ran up to a new high of $415.50 per tbf, highest price level in 2-1/2 years, and then again hit profit taking. That month closed $0.90 lower at $412.30 per tbf and November finished $1.50 lower at $367.50. Other months finished $2.50 lower to $2.10 higher with only May up. Profit taking developed after the new home report failed to draw in as much buying as expected, they said. The Commerce Department reported new single-family home sales up 7.9 percent to an annual rate of 783,000 units, the highest since 784,000 in February. Economists had expected July sales at 728,000 units. Underlying support continued to reflect the strong tone to cash lumber. Mills continue to ask $420 per tbf or more for prompt shipment, cash sources said. --Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725
