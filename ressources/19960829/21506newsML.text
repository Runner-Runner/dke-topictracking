Panamanian lawmakers voted on Wednesday to begin an impeachment process against a Supreme Court judge to determine whether he used his influence to set drug traffickers free, officials said. Judge Jose Manuel Faundes will be temporarily stripped of his duties starting on Thursday until the end of the impeachment process, legislator Miguel Bush of the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) told reporters. Bush did not specify how long the process, which was approved by a majority vote of lawmakers in the one-house, 72-member Congress, could take. Faundes has five days to appear before Congress to respond to charges that he used his influence to grant accused drug traffickers special permits at least four times this year. If found guilty, Faundes will be removed from his seat and prohibited from leaving the country, which would set a precedent in Panamanian history.
