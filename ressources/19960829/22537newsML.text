Bank Leumi said it has bought 10 percent of Africa Israel Investments since Wednesday, raising its stake in the conglomerate to 65 percent of the voting rights. The Israeli bank paid about 200 million shekels for the shares, purchased off the trading floor where they have risen by 20 percent in the last two days.   A senior banking source said Leumi has purchased the shares in Africa Israel to ensure a solid majority in order that the spinoff of Africa Israel's insurance holdings goes through. Africa Israel will hold an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on September 19 to approve the spinoff of Leumi Insurance Holdings. The divestment is a prerequisite for a deal enabling Italian insurer Generali Spa to take control of Leumi Insurance's subsidiary, Migdal. Bank Leumi owns 27.72 percent of Leumi Insurance and Africa Israel holds 72.28 percent. Leumi Insurance holds 68.1 percent of Migdal while Generali holds 27.1 percent and others hold 4.8 percent. Leumi, which must reduce its holdings in Africa Israel to 25 percent by the year's end to comply with Israeli banking law, believes it will get more money by spinning off the insurance holdings and selling them separately from Africa. Earlier this month Africa Israel's board of directors approved the divestment. Israeli businessmen Motti Zisser and Eitan Wertheimer are also pursuing Africa Israel shares and are trying to stop the insurance spin-off by obtaining 25 percent of the company. News reports said the two hold as much as 16 percent of Africa Israel. The two could not be reached for comment. An announcement to the Tel Aviv bourse confirmed the two bought a lot of 22,048 Africa Israel class 0.1 shares off the floor on August 27, equal to 7.575 percent of the voting rights. The share was down 0.5 percent on Thursday at 469,477 points. Africa Israel also has interests in real estate, tourism, hotels and construction. - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
