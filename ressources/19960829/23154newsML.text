The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) plans to implement volume discounts on broker commissions for its aluminium futures contract when it begins trading next April, exchange officials said on Thursday. They added that registered commercial hedgers would also be offered substantially lower commission rates. The moves, which are still subject to approval by a general meeting of the exchange and by regulatory authorities, were designed to encourage use of the controversial aluminium contract as a hedging tool by Japanese end users.   Regular commissions will be set at 6,000 yen per contract, while members and registered hedgers will be charged 1,000 yen. Registered hedgers must pay an initial registration fee of 50,000 yen plus an annual fee of 150,000 yen. For large orders, a 30 percent discount will be offered on that part of the order beyond the first 1,000 lots. One lot will equal 10 tonnes. The idea of using commission discounts to promote the aluminium contract has proved highly controversial, provoking widespread opposition among small Japanese brokerages that depend on commissions for most of their revenue.   The commission levels and other contract specifications TOCOM announced on Thursday were set forward by a special committee including trade house officials, industry representatives, commodity brokers and academics. The committee also proposed initial margins of 60,000 yen at aluminium prices of 149 yen per kg or less, 75,000 yen at prices of 150 to 199 yen, 90,000 yen at 200 to 249 yen, and 105,000 yen at 250 yen or more. On the London Metal Exchange, three-month aluminium is currently trading at about 160 yen per kg.   Daily limits in price movements were set at four yen for prices of 149 yen per kg or less, five yen for prices of 150 to 199 yen, six yen for prices of 200 to 249 yen, and seven yen for prices of 250 yen or more. The aluminium contract is scheduled to begin trading next April 7. Regarding volume discounts on commissions, exchange officials noted, by way of precedent, that a study of gold and platinum trading on TOCOM in 1995 indicated that there were on average only a few transactions per month exceeding 1,000 lots. --Tokyo Commodity Desk (81-3 3432 6179)
