Regional publisher and media operator Rural Press Ltd said on Thursday it had held discussions with a number of Asian parties about a possible publishing or radio joint venture in Asia. "We have had some discussions regarding joint ventures in the media in Asia, in both print and radio," managing director Brian McCarthy told reporters. McCarthy said he was not in a position to make any announcement or give any further details. Rural Press was also looking for acquisitions in regional publishing and radio in New Zealand and Australia, he said.   The company would look to fund any such acquisition through debt issuance rather than through any equity raising. "At this stage we could do it with debt," McCarthy said. "We don't anticipate going to the market in the short term." Rural Press' debt to equity ratio stood at about 54 percent at the end of June 1996. "We don't regard that as too high," he said, adding that Rural Press had not revalued upwards the value of its mastheads in the same way other publishers may have to make their debt ratios look more attractive.   McCarthy said the company would also look to use the preference shares at its disposal as a way of paying for new acquisitions. Earlier on Thursday Rural Press reported a six percent rise in net profit to A$31.53 million but said it would be harder to increase profit in the first half of the current 1996/97 year (July/June) than in the second half. Rural Press' shares closed Thursday at A$4.16, down 14 cents on their Wednesday close. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
