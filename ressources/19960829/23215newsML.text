South Korea's petroleum products demand rose 7.4 percent to 412.0 million barrels in the first seven months of 1996 from 383.5 million a year ago, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said on Thursday. This compares with a 9.4 percent rise in domestic consumption in the same period of last year. The ministry said in a statement demand growth for naphtha slowed due to maintenance shutdowns at petrochemical firms. Tougher environmental restrictions, which encouraged use of cleaner fuel, dragged demand for C-type fuel oil.   The statement said the oil refiners produced 397.9 million barrels of petroleum products in the first seven months against 362.7 million the year before. Hyundai Oil Refinery Co's new 200,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) crude distillation unit, which started operation in late February, boosted the output. South Korea currently has a refining capacity of 2.02 million bpd.
