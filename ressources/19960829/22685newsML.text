1645 GMT - The Brussels bourse finished lower on Thursday, in line with other European markets and the Dow Jones, which stood 40 points down when Brussels closed. * The Dow was hit by strong U.S. July home sales and an upward revision to second quarter U.S. GDP growth, which sent the U.S. 30-year bond's yield above the key seven percent level. * The Bel-20 index closed 13.02 points or 0.75 percent lower at 1,730.03. Total volume in Belgian shares was worth 2.47 billion francs. * Insurer AG down 1.6% after release of 1st half earnings. -- Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6810, Fax +32 2 230 7710
