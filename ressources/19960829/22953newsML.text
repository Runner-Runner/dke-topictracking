Postipankki's economic research department raised its forecast for Finnish 1997 gross domestic product growth to 3.0 percent from its May forecast of 2.6 percent, the bank said in a report on Thursday. "Prospects both on export markets and especially at home have turned slightly brighter," Postipankki said. Its 1996 GDP growth forecast was unchanged at 2.3 percent. Postipankki revised the 1996 CPI forecast a shade lower -- to 0.8 percent year-on-year from 1.0 percent in May. "Next year, too, the the rise in consumer prices remains slow," Postipankki said. It forecast a 1.4 percent yr/yr rise.
