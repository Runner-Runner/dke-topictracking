German insurance group DBV Holding AF said on Thursday it saw a chance to raise its dividend in the future after increasing its 1995 payout to 10 marks from 9.50 marks. Chairman Manfred Broska told the annual shareholders' meeting the group's merger this year with Swiss insurer Winterthur's German business increased the possibility that it could increase its dividend. Broska did not give a timeframe.   DBV says merger raises chance for higher =2 In his speech to shareholders, who are to vote on the merger plan today, Broska repeated that the move ought to mean a significant boost for DBV's 1996 earnings after the group posted 1995 net profit of 75.6 million marks. Winterthur's German units were expected to turn a 1996 net profit of over 20 million marks, Broska said, ample to cover the expected extra dividend payout of 7.2 million marks which the merger would demand on the basis of a 10-mark dividend. DBV announced in July that it planned to join its capital structure with Winterthur's German business to reflect their gradual fusion since Winterthur bought a controlling interest in DBV from Germany's Commerzbank in 1994. DBV is to buy a 99 percent stake in Winterthur's main German units, three Munich-based firms which are now controlled by the CW Holding company, in turn owned by Winterthur. CW will receive DBV shares in return. DBV is raising its capital to 169.4 million marks from 133.3 million marks. The merger is expected to raise DBV's premium income this year by 40 percent to 5.3 billion marks, Broska said. Group premiums would rise to 5.7 billion marks counting Winterthur's two Hamburg based units, Transatlantische Versicherung and Telcon Versicherung, which are expected to be merged into DBV in due course. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
