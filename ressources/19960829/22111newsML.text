-- Prudential Securities analyst started National Semiconductor Corp with a buy rating and a 12-month target price of $30 per share. The stock closed at 16-3/8 yesterday.   -- The analyst said he expects earnings for the current fiscal year ending May 1997 of $1.50 per share, an estimate that includes the company's Fairchild operations, but does not include the expected write-down of $1.60 to $1.70 a share he anticipates National will take for disposal of the division. -- He said he expects earnings of $1.70 per share for the year ending May 1998, a figure that includes no contribution from Fairchild, which he expects will be sold in the second half of fiscal 1997.   -- "Clearly we are attracted to what I believe is the tail end of a multi-year transition," Edelstone said, referring to the realignment of National's businesses under the leadership lately of Brian Halla, a former LSI Logic Corp official, and previously under Gil Amelio, now the head of Apple Computer Inc. -- "We look at fiscal 1997 as a transition year with the pay-off coming in 1998," he said. The sale of Fairchild, the last of National's commodity chip businesses will allow it to focus on its higher-margin analog and mixed signal products. -- These latter products, which now account for about 60 percent of revenues will be responsible for roughly 85 percent of revenues once the Fairchild transaction is accomplished, he noted. -- E.
