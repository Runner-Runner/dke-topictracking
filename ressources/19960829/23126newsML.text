The Thai overnight interbank rate fell to 6.25-6.50 percent in late trade on Thursday from 7.00 percent earlier and 7.00-7.25 percent late on Wednesday on higher market liquidity, dealers said. "Banks have a lot of surplus funds so they offered a lower interbank rate today," said one dealer at a European bank. She said liquidity was still high because the bimonthly corporate tax payment may not have been paid in full yet. The baht edged up to 25.293-25.296 to the dollar in late trade from 25.299-25.301 earlier on some fund inflows, dealers said.   "The dollar eased slightly against the baht from the morning. There was some foreign inflows, but not much," said one currency dealer. The one-month swap premium was at 5.25/5.75 satangs per dollar late compared with 5.50/6.50 earlier. The mid-rate was fixed at 25.29 to the dollar against 25.27 on Wednesday. -- Tang Nguyen (662) 252-9950
