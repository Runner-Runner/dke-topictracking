The Brent/Dubai spread narrowed on Thursday from Wednesday as the Dubai market tightened ahead of India's crude buying tender for October deliveries. In early afternoon dealings, traders said there was an offer on the October Brent/Dubai at $1.47 and a notional bid at $1.30. November Brent/Dubai was assessed at $1.50/$1.58 from a day-earlier $1.57/$1.68. The arbitage has narrowed on the near month owing to an overnight surge in Dubai values, where the October/November intermonth spread has ballooned out to 53/60 cents from 35/45 cents.   Traders estimated that up to 12 wet October Dubai cargoes have been placed with end users, leaving four or five cargoes available for the market. The Indian Oil Corp (IOC) tendered last week to buy one million barrels of October crude. Traders have placed their bets on India taking mostly Dubai because the Brent/Dubai spread has been trending higher, eliminating the potential for West African crude being tendered. The tender closes later on Thursday and validity is until late Friday Asian time.   But in addition, traders said there are a number of shorts in the October Dubai paper market which is adding to the squeeze on Dubai paper. A flurry of Dubai intermonth deals were done overnight with Oct/Nov trading at 49 and 50 cents. --Singapore Newsroom (+65 870 3081)
