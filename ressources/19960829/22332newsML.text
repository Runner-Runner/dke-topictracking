International Technology Corporation said Thursday The Carlyle Group will acquire $45 million of International Technology preferred stock in a deal that gives Carlyle-appointed executives a majority on International Technology's board for five years. The Carlyle Group is a Washington D.C.-based merchant banking firm. It is making the investment through its Carlyle Partners II LP private equity fund. The preferred stock will convert into 22.5 million common shares at $2.00 per share. The deal also includes five-year warrants to purchase 5 million shares at $3.00 a share.   International Technology said the convertible preferred stock will pay zero dividends in year one, a three percent in-kind dividend in year two and a six percent cash dividend thereafter. There is no mandatory redemption provision. The company has an option to redeem the convertible preferred stock beginning in the eighth year after the closing. The funds will be used for financing future acquisitions, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.
