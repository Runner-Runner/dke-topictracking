Austrian shares clawed their way off earlier lows to end marginally firmer on Thursday, with index propped up by OMV and Flughafen. Traders see the market trading with a solid tone, supported by selective buying, but expect the index to remain within its narrow trading range. "I see the market with a positive bias, albeit of a selective nature," said one trader, adding the ATX would likely trade between 1,020 and 1,042 points. The ATX index of 21 blue chips gained 2.88 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 1,038.48 -- a shade off the day's high at 1,038.74 after earlier falling to 1,032.07. Gainers outnumbered losers, with 11 higher, eight lower and two unchanged. The day's leading gainer was chip producer Austria Mikro Systeme AG, up 2.73 percent at 714 schillings, while the top loser was Radex-Heraklith, shedding 2.14 percent to 297.5 schillings. Oil and chemicals group OMV was the most actively traded, firming 1.4 percent to 1,035.5 on turnover of 48,342. "There's still demand for OMV. OMV could carry on up to 1,040/50," said a trader. Viscose fibre manufacturer Lenzing lost 11.2 schillings to 665 after reporting first half losses and warning the second half would also see losses of the same magnitude. "Lenzing is not bullish," said another trader. The broad-based Vienna Bourse index added on 0.07 percent to 405.15 points. The September ATX future advanced 3.7 points to 1,040.5 on turnover of 299 contracts.
