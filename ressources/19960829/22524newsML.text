Iran's security chief warned in remarks published on Thursday that terrorism charges raised against Iranian leaders at a trial in Berlin could hurt German interests in the Islamic republic. "We did not expect Germany to allow the trial to be diverted and this would not be without effects on our relations with Germany and German interests in Iran," Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan told the state-run daily Iran. The warning came amid tension between Tehran and its main trade partner Bonn over German officials allowing exiled former president Abolhassan Banisadr to testify at a trial over the 1992 killings of three Iranian Kurdish rebel leaders and their translator in a Berlin restaurant. Banisadr, Iran's first president who fled after being deposed in 1981, angered Tehran last week by accusing Iranian leaders in court of ordering the gangland-style slayings. Iran denied the charges and dismissed the testimony as baseless. Tehran has also asked Bonn to extradite Banisadr for alleged hijacking. "This trial is politically influenced by German pressure groups and by the Zionist regime (Israel) and has no value in our view," said Fallahiyan, whose ministry is also in charge of internal security. "The Germans are smarter than to believe we cannot see these problems," said Fallahiyan, who is under an arrest warrant issued in March by German authorities on suspicion of ordering the assassinations. Fallahiyan repeated earlier statements by Tehran that the killings were linked to in-fighting among opposition groups and that the case was being used by Israel and the United States in a campaign to isolate Iran by accusing it of terrorism, the newspaper said. Banisadr is due to appear again at the trial on September 5 to continue his testimony, which has backed up German prosecutors' allegations that Iran ordered the attack.
