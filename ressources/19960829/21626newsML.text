Bondholders of beleaguered Amcol Holdings will go to court in a bid to secure an assurance they will be paid, a source close to the case said on Thursday. The source said they would try on Friday to get the High Court to instruct Amcol's judicial managers to get an assurance from white knight Sinar Mas that bondholders would be paid in full. The interim judicial managers -- Nicky Tan, Deborah Ong and Yeoh Oon Jin, all partners of Price Waterhouse -- were due to appear in court on Friday to have their appointments confirmed. "The position of the bondholders is that they are not happy to confirm them (the interim judicial managers) unless certain conditions are met," the source, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. At a meeting on Tuesday, more than 100 Amcol bondholders met the judicial managers to seek a commitment on bond obligations from Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas before Friday's court date. The source said lawyers for HSBC Trustee, which is acting on behalf of the bondholders, would air bondholders' grievances and state their conditions at the hearing. The bondholders, with interests in three classes of Amcol bonds totalling S$285 million, represent Amcol's largest creditor. "The first thing the bondholders want is a written guarantee, perferably backed by a bank," the source said. They feared that they could be "left dangling in the air" without an assurance, he said. He added that the judicial managers had not revealed other rescue offers and creditors and shareholders could therefore not judge whether they got the best deal. Property and trading firm Amcol has been under judicial management since July 21, when a Price Waterhouse audit revealed the company had liabilities of S$1.16 billion. -- Singapore newsroom (65-8703080)
