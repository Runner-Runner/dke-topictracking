Sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months, the Commerce Department said Thursday, driving prices up in a strong housing market. Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February, when new homes were selling at rate of 784,000 a year. It was the largest increase in monthly sales since an 8.8 percent rise in January and was sharply contrary to Wall Street economists' forecasts of a drop in sales to a rate of 734,000. Sales have been expected to level off or decline because mortgage rates have climbed significantly since the beginning of the year, but so far show little sign of doing so. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates for a 30-year mortgage loan averaged 8.25 percent in July, down from 8.32 percent in June. But that was well above the average 7.03 percent rate available last January. Analysts said beforehand that the availability of adjustable-rate mortgages, together with rising employment and incomes, have bolstered the housing industry. Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said the volume of total U.S. mortgage applications fell 5.1 percent in the week ended Aug. 23. The volume of applications to refinance mortgages fell 6.1 percent in the latest survey week, while applications to purchase mortgages fell 4.8 percent, the trade group said. On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing, or used, homes eased 0.5 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million -- a second straight monthly drop, but still a higher rate than that recorded for any month in 1995. The department said June sales of new homes fell a revised 1.8 percent to 726,000 a year instead of declining 5.3 percent to 734,000 as it reported a month ago. Prices for new homes climbed strongly in July, with the median sales price jumping to a record $143,000 from $140,000 in June. The median marks the midway point for prices, with half of all new homes selling above this price and half selling below. The average sales price gained to $169,800 in July from $165,300 in June. Sales of new homes picked up during July in every region of the country except the Northeast, where they decreased 1.4 percent to an annual rate of 72,000. In the Midwest, sales soared 12.5 percent to 144,000 a year and in the West they were up 8.8 percent to an annual rate of 223,000. Sales in the South, the nation's largest regional market, rose strongly, by 7.5 percent to an annual rate of 344,000. The department noted that the sales rate for new homes has exceeded 700,000 a year in each of the first seven months of this year. That is the longest string of sales at such a brisk rate in a decade, since an eight-month period from November 1985 through June 1986.
