The Turkish lira eased to 86,250 per dollar from Wednesday's close of 86,210 after firming to 86,100 during the day because of a cash squeeze. The central bank's move to raise its dollar rate for banks' compulsory currency transfers helped the lira fall despite cash shortage. The bank lent 13.3 trillion lira at the close at 75 percent. The bank raised its rate to 86,275 lira due to a firmer dollar/mark parity after opening unchanged at 86,200 lira. Overnight money rates jumped to 74.75 percent after closing at an average 61.68 yesterday, as banks were squeezed for fresh cash ahead of a three-day holiday weekend starting on Friday, national victory day. In the t-bill market the average overnight repo rate firmed on demand for cash but yields on long-term t-bills fell. The yield on the most active March 5 paper fell to 132.27 percent from Wednesday's 132.46. --Istanbul newsroom +90-212-275 08 75
