The Bank of Israel intervened in the trading of the shekel, buying dollars to prevent the shekel from trading beyond the band within which it is allowed to fluctuate, dealers said. "Just before the representative rates were published (at 1215 GMT) the central bank intervened to bring the shekel-basket rate to seven percent below the slope," a dealer at United Mizrahi Bank said. "After the rates were published and about 10 mintues before the end of trading (at 1400 GMT) the central bank bought again," he said.   The amount of dollars purchased, though small, was slightly more than the few million bought on Wednesday, dealers said. "The Bank of Israel intervened in the market, buying from us on a very low scale," a dealer at Israel Discount Bank confirmed. Despite the intervention the shekel-basket rate slipped to 3.5377 at the end of trading from the representative rate of 3.5384. The rate is now 7.01 (corrects from 7.1) percent below the slope, or just outside the trading band. The shekel can fluctuate seven percent above or below a diagonal slope designed to devalue the Israeli currency at six percent a year against a basket of currencies representing Israel's main trading partners. If the shekel-basket exchange rate reaches the lower band the central bank supports the rate by buying foreign currency. The central bank does not comment on currency interventions. - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
