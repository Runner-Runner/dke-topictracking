Audi AG management board chairman Herbert Demel said on Thursday he expected 1996 sales at the German luxury carmaker to climb more than five percent and return on sales to top the 1995 level. "Sales are trending to climb over five percent" for the year, Demel told Reuters in an interview. Demel also said the return on sales against pre-tax profits at the carmaker, a unit of Volkswagen AG, would be above the 3.5 percent level seen in 1995. Audi is seeking to reach a return on sales goal of 6.5 percent in the long-term. Demel declined to predict exactly when Audi would reach that goal. Demel said Audi's sales grew at a faster rate than the market during the first half of 1996 and said he expected a similar outlook for the second half of the year. Audi earlier reported that six-month sales rose to 9.3 billion marks from 8.2 billion marks, while net profit rose to 111 million marks from 22 million marks in the year-ago period. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
