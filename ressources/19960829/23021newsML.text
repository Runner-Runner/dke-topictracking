Pharmaceutical manufacturer CSL Ltd said on Thursday solid growth in each of its five divisions was responsible for an 18.2 percent jump in annual net profit. CSL reported a net profit of A$29.0 million for the year to June 30, up ffom $24.54 million previously. It said bioplasma revenue growth was strong at 14 percent, while veterinary was 10 percent ahead of last year's record high despite continuing difficult trading conditions.   CSL said an increase in FLUVAX influenza vaccine's domestic market share in the second half underpinned a strong finish for the pharmaceutical division. Excellent revenue growth in CSL's U.S.-based cell culture business, particularly in Europe and Japan, helped to boost international revenues by seven percent. "We are pleased to be able to report such good results in only our second full year as a listed company," managing director Brian McNamee said in a statement. CSL was formerly the government-owned Commonwealth Serum Laboratory. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
