The Bank of Israel has no intention of changing the present trading band within which the shekel is allowed to fluctuate, sources at the central bank said. The officials said that at this stage there is no intention of enlarging or abolishing the trading band. "There are no talks about this and for sure this won't happen tomorrow, the day after, in another week or in another month," one official said. "Of course we have thoughts about the long term, but there is nothing on the agenda at the moment." The shekel can fluctuate in a trading band of 7.0 percent above or below a slope designed to devalue the Israeli currency at six percent a year against a basket of key currencies. If the shekel-basket exchange rate reaches the lower trading band the central bank intervenes by buying foreign currency. The Bank of Israel intervened in trading on Tuesday and Wednesday by buying small amounts of dollars to stop the shekel-basket exchange rate from falling below the bottom of the band. The officials said the central bank wanted only to preserve the band and had no intention of depreciating the shekel by making massive interventions in foreign exchange trading. They said that all changes in the parameters of the band need to be done with the approval of the Treasury and they doubted the Treasury would approve such a move with the rate being so close to the bottom of the band. Widening the trading band would allow the shekel to appreciate further, if the current trend continues, and cause even further damage to exporters, they said. At the end of May last year, Treasury heads decided to enlarge the band from 5.0 percent above and below the slope to 7.0 percent. But when they did this the shekel-basket exchange rate was at the middle of the band and not at its bottom, the officials said.
