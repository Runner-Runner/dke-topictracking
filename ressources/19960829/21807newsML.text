Midwest cash hog prices were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt lower Friday amid continued pressure from large hog supplies and soft pork product prices, livestock dealers said. Top prices in Iowa and Minnesota were expected to slip $0.50 at $57.00 to $57.50 for hogs delivered at plants and Illinois top prices could range steady to $0.50 lower at $56.50 to $57.00. Indiana and Ohio buyers said top prices could range from $55.00 to $56.00. Several large packers reportedly have secured enough hogs to start operations after Monday's Labor Day holiday.   Packer operating margins slipped, spurring talk that weekend slaughter will be very light and that some plants would close early Friday. A seasonal increase in hog supplies was pushing pork product prices and eroding the operating margins, market sources said. USDA Thursday estimated slaughter at 354,000 head. The week to date estimate was 1.393 million head, up 3.0 percent from a week ago and up 2.1 percent from a year ago, USDA said. --Chicago newsdesk 312-408-8720--
