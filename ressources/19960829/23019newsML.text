Legal experts believe there is a good case for an injunction on the sale of Forestry Corp, Wood Industries Union national secretary Jim Jones said on Thursday. There was evidence that an injunction could be granted on the grounds that Fletcher had a tax advantage over the other bidders and that the Government did not get the NZ$2 billion book valuation of the corporation from Fletcher's bid, the New Zealand Press Assocciation reported. "Our legal experts tell us there a case to be answered," Jones said. However, legal action would not proceed unless the union could find enough money to fund it.   "Our legal costs could run into millions. We are searching for those resources." In the days leading up to the formal hand-over of the corporation the Trade Union Federation, including the Wood Industries Union, was planning a campaign of direct, political and legal action. "We will continue to pressure the Government right up until the election. We will stage protests in Rotorua and all the main centres," Jones said.   The main concerns about the sale related to the economic benefits to the country, the future development of the forestry industry and the future of workers and employment conditions. After research and expert opinion it was evident the sale did not stack up on all counts, in spite of Fletcher Challenge's reassurances, Jones said. On the industrial front, the union was talking to FCL over the future of the workers and their employment conditions. Indications that FCL would increase contracting work was a concern in terms of deteriorating safety and working conditions.   FCLs' promises to step up work at Waipa as it had in Taupo may create extra jobs, but working conditions could suffer. "The workers at Fletcher Taupo plant did not welcome the recent three shift system. They are not happy with it," Jones said. FCNZ was sold last week to a consortium comprising Brierley Investments Ltd and China's Citic. --  Wellington Newsroom (64-4-4734746)
