Shanghai copper futures ended mostly down in slow trading on Thursday, due to an overnight consolidation on the London Metal Exchange which disappointed Shanghai speculators, traders said. The most active December 1996 contract ended at 20,430 yuan ($2,459) per tonne, losing 70 yuan. It opened at 20,400 yuan, hitting an intra-day low of 20,370 and a high of 20,440. September rose 50 to 21,100 yuan and October 50 to 20,750. November was unchanged at 20,500. The January 1997 contract fell 30 to 20,400, February 20 to 20,400 and March 100 to 20,400. Combined volume fell to 5,025 tonnes from 12,310.   Copper opened down and most contracts moved in a narrow range of 100 yuan for most of the session. Traders said speculative buying surged on Wednesday caused by a copper strike in Chile, which was expected to trigger sharp rises on the LME last night. But investors were disappointed by overnight movements on the LME. "Profit-taking by disappointed speculators pushed most contracts down and thin volume indicates most investors have lost short-term direction," one trader said.   Traders expect most investors to be sidelined on the unclear short-term market trend and copper to move in a narrow range between 20,000 and 20,500 yuan in the next few days "Neither buyers and sellers have enough reasons or power to drive copper out of this narrow range in the short term," a second trader said. Aluminum ended mixed. September fell 40 to 14,350 yuan, October rose 10 to 14,260 and November 80 to 14,250. Combined volume rose to 580 tonnes from 380.
