South Korea's industrial output in July rose 8.0 percent year-on-year from a 15.0 percent rise a year earlier, provisional National Statistical Office (NSO) figures showed on Thursday. 						  July   June    July 95     Industrial output		     +8.0    +3.8    +15.0     Ex-factory shipment		   +6.7    +3.2    +13.3     Inventories			    +18.3   +20.9    +11.1     Factory operation rate		82.7    77.8     81.9     Wholesale/retail sales		+6.8    +6.5     +7.7     Domestic machinery orders	   -0.7   +21.0    -16.3     Import permits of machinery	+47.8   +26.5    -27.3     Domestic construction orders     -12.7    +7.6    +86.3 Note: figures in percent, year-on-year change. The NSO figures showed industrial output rose 5.1 percent in July month-on-month from a 5.6 percent decline a month ago. This was attributed to a settlement of labour disputes. Industrial output growth was the lowest in 28 months in June as labour strife crippled the auto industry. In addition, there was a spate of maintainance shutdowns in the petrochemical industry in that month.   A NSO statement said output of semiconductors, electronics parts and garments fell in July. It said output of heavy industrial goods in July rose 10.5 percent year-on-year against 20.6 percent a year ago. Production of light industrial products fell 1.3 percent from a 2.2 percent rise a year earler. Ex-factory shipments for exports in the month increased only 2.3 percent year-on-year against a 25.3 percent rise a year before. Shipments to the domestic market rose 8.5 percent compared with a rise of 9.2 percent a year ago.   June inventory was the lowest level since January's 16.2 percent. But that of steel products and semiconductors increased due to sluggish domestic consumption and exports respectively. A sharp fall in domestic housing building orders caused overall construction orders to decline in July, the statement said. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5647
