A sharp fall in Grasim Industries virtually wiped out previous gains as the Delhi bourse closed marginally higher, brokers said. The indicative Delhi Stock Exchange index closed 1.98 points higher at 799.72. The index had surged 15.93 points to 813.67 at mid-session.   Grasim Industries' share was quoted on the Delhi Stock Exchange after a gap of almost two and a half months. The share plunged 78 rupees or 13.22 percent from its previous listing of 590 rupees on June 13. "The session was mainly dominated by buyers forcing speculators to square up their positions on fears of further rally in share prices," said Harjit Kumar of brokers J.S. Chadha. Brokers said the market was boosted by reports that the government was considering offering tax reliefs to industry. The Economic Times reported on Thursday that Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was likely to grant tax relief to the steel industry from a minimum alternate tax on corporations, proposed in the government's 1996/97 (April-March) budget. The steel industry is expected to be hit by cuts in custom duties which Chidambaram announced when he presented the 1996/97 budget to parliament last month. Parliament is scheduled to vote on the budget before its session ends on September 13. Other newspapers have said Chidambaram might partially exempt other industries from the tax before parliament votes on the budget. TISCO, after moving in alternate bouts of buying and selling, closed 4.25 rupees higher at 194.20, brokers said. State Bank of India ended 1.80 rupees higher at 269.50. Reliance Industries, after touching a mid-session peak of 214.75, closed 1.65 rupees higher at 210.75, they said. ACC gained 21 rupees to close at 2,150. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
