Swiss engineering group Georg Fischer AG said on Thursday it expected its results to improve in the second half of 1996, but said it would be hard to achieve the level of 1995.   In a statement accompanying its first-half results, Fischer said that negative influences have weakened. "We therefore expect an improved corporate result for the second half of the year," it said. "It will be difficult, however, to reach the result of the previous year," Fischer said. Fischer said mid-year figures reflect "excellent results" in piping systems and manufacturing technology business. But they also show "unsatisfactory contributions" of the automotive products and plant engineering groups. Group results in the automotive division for the final quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996 were negatively affected by the production start-up of several new component lines and introduction of new technologies, it said. "By the second quarter of 1996, these profitability setbacks had already been overcome, and the upward trend continues," it said. It also said that restructuring in its plant engineering group will positively affect results in the 1996 second half. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340
