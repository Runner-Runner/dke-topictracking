Oceaneering International Inc said Thursday the floating production, storage and offloading system Zafiro Producer began production for Mobil Corp at the Zafiro field offshore Equatorial Guinea on August 25. Wednesday, Mobil announced the beginning of production 18 months after the Zafiro field's discovery in March 1995. Oceaneering said its field development and production contracting division performed the Zafiro Producer conversion project on a fast-track schedule which required the equivalent of 120 man years of effort to be completed in six months. Following award of a contract to own and operate the system on November 30, 1995, Oceaneering purchased the M/T Swift, a very large crude carrier, for conversion, which included life-extension repairs, and installation of a production process system, 12-point spread mooring system, helideck, oil offloading system, and a flare boom. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.
