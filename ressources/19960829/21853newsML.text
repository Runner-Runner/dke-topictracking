Noranda Inc said refined lead production will remain at present levels and may be even higher following the cut in concentrates production at the company's Brunswick mine in Canada. Earlier Thursday Noranda announced that production at its Brunswick zinc and lead mine in Canada was being cut because seismic activity affected the ability to produce at planned levels. Some 40,000 tonnes of contained zinc in concentrates will be lost this year, Noranda said.   The lead concentrates and refined metal markets are much tighter than their zinc counterparts. Ivan Miller, Noranda's vice president, commercial, said lead concentrates production will be cut by 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes during the remainder of this year. However, the grade of the concentrates may be increased in the remaining concentrates produced, thus enabling Noranda to maintain and even raise refined lead production at its smelter.   Noranda's concentrates currently grade about 38 percent lead, but this could be raised to 42 to 43 percent or even as high as 45 percent, Miller said. Noranda currently produces about 110,000 tonnes of lead metal annually at its smelter, but full capacity could be as much as 120,000 tonnes. Miller was unsure if Noranda will have to buy more lead concentrates on the open market to top up any shortfall from Brunswick. "If we do have to buy more, we are already buying significant quantities of lead concentrate so on a proportionate basis it would not be a huge increase in purchases," Miller said. Brunswick supplied just over half of Noranda's lead smelter concentrates requirements. All the mine's lead concentrates were consumed internally. -- Huw Jones, New York Commodities 212-859-1646
