Teradyne Inc., a leading manufacturer of automatic test equipment, said Thursday it will eliminate about 300 workers due to a downturn in the semiconductor industry. The action affects regular and temporary employees, as well as contractors. Teradyne said it expects to take a pretax charge of $10 million to $12 million, or 7 cents to 8 cents per share after taxes, in the second half of the year to pay for the layoffs. The amount and timing of the charges are subject to several uncertainties, including the nature of extended benefits provided to the affected employees, who were notified beginning Aug. 28. They will receive extended benefits based on length of service, as well as outplacement assistance, the company said. About 175 of the job cuts are in Boston, while the rest are in Teradyne's West Coast operations. Boston-based Teradyne also makes connection systems for the electronics and telecommunications industries. It had 1995 sales of $1.2 billion and has about 5,200 employees worldwide. Teradyne's stock rose 25 cents to $15.50 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday.
