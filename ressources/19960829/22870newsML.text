Iberia said it has launched special offer ex-Germany cargo rates to Spanish tourist destinations effective September 1. The airline said it will charge 1.20 marks per kg for cargo carried on services from Frankfurt to selected destinations. These are Valencia, Malaga, Alicante, Palma de Mallorca, Zaragoza and Bilbao. Miguel Herter, Iberia cargo manager Germany, Austria and Scandinavia, told Reuters: "We have to win cargo away from the charter airlines. "It is not a big market (to these destinations) but we want to win it away from LTU and the others. I want to take part in this market." Iberia flies daily from Frankfurt to Bilbao and Valencia with a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, four times a week to Alicante and Palma with an Airbus A320, and three times a week to Malaga and Zaragoza. Market rates to Spanish tourist destinations tend to be low reflecting substantial capacity from charter airlines and relatively small demand, observers pointed out. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44-171-542-7706 Fax+44-171-542-5017
