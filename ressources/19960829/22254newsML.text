IMM currency futures recovered from the biggest losses in late trading, but most still ended pit trading weaker. The late rebound occurred as U.S. Treasury bond futures and U.S. equities extended losses, pullbacks that brokers said may have added additional lift to currencies. But traders said the move back up toward unchanged and to pit-session peaks in Continental units stemmed mainly from shortcovering after the lack of downside followthrough. September marks during during the morning eroded below $0.6763 or 1.48 spot but halted at $0.6754 or 1.4820 spot.   The contract met pressure when French president Jacques Chirac reaffirmed on Thursday his government's commitment to meeting the deadline for European monetary union. Chirac will meet in Bonn on Sunday with German chancellor Helmut Kohl, with discussion expected to include bilateral, European and world issues. Earlier on Thursday, French prime minister Alain Juppe also reaffirmed France's commitment to EMU. Traders said sentiment generally favored the mark after the dollar's failure on the upside following the Bundesbank rate cut and when Japan kept rates steady.   One fund was seen buying up to 1,000 September mark futures on the contract's recovery, floor brokers said. But action was brisk again in the Canadian dollar, where traders said one firm sold 1,200 September Canadian dollar futures during the day, sales they tied to talk that the firm is long 10,000 December Canadian dollar calls and was hedging. They said the firm likely needs to sell more futures to become properly hedged, which they said could limit the extent of the unit's advance temporarily.
