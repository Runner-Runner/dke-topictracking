Jordan's prime minister said he criticised Israel's expansion of West Bank settlements in talks he held with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Thursday. "We informed the president that we do not accept any analysis that calls for continuing settlement expansion and at the same time to say that the peace process is all right," Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti told reporters after meeting Arafat. The Palestinian leader said he asked Kabariti to brief King Hussein on Israel's plans, disclosed hours before the meeting, to build new homes in existing settlements in the West Bank. Arafat said the planned construction of what Israeli media reports said were between 2,000 and 3,550 housing units, was another obstacle towards implementing his peace deals with the Jewish state. "I look up to my brother, His Majesty King Hussein, to help us and I am sure he will in these very difficult circumstances that we face," Arafat said. Kabariti, who flew by helicopter from Jordan to the West Bank town of Ramallah to see Arafat, said the kingdom wanted Israel to end a closure imposed on Palestinian areas after suicide bombings by Moslem militants in February and March. Calling the closure a "siege", Kabariti said its lifting would mean "we could say that the (peace) process can continue with goodwill". He said he had delivered a message from King Hussein to Arafat "expressing and renewing our stand and support for the Palestinian National Authority...and (Arafat's) efforts to achieve peace". Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty two years ago. The prime minister's visit, his first trip outside the country since Jordan was shaken by food riots this month, came against the backdrop of a Palestinian general strike in the West Bank and Gaza. Arafat called the four-hour strike, which was followed by a meeting of two senior Israeli and PLO negotiators, to protest against Israeli policy on settlements and Jerusalem.
