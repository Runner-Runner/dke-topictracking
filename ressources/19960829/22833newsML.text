Job cuts in the German automobile industry slowed during the first half of 1996 following recent years of sharp cutbacks, the VDA German car industry association said on Thursday. VDA President Erika Emmerich said industry employment during the first six months of 1996 fell 0.4 percent from year-ago levels. The 1995 first half saw job cuts of one percent while the 1994 first half saw an 8.3 percent reduction in the German car industry workforce from 1993 levels. Emmerich said average industry employment during the first six months of the year was 654,000 people, of which 363,000 people were directly involved with vehicle production. The VDA also said that a five percent rise in 1996 domestic car sales was possible. Emmerich said the consumer vehicle market segment in Germany has developed somewhat more favourable than earlier expected. She also said that domestic demand was expected to firm further from current levels. The growth rate for 1996 was expected to be about two to three percent lower than the 1995 level but Emmerich said the 1996 results were still expected to be satisfactory.
