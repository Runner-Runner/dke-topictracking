U.S. bankruptcy filings rose 12 percent to an all-time high of 297,162 in the second quarter of 1996, the American Bankruptcy Institute said. Quoting statistics from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, it said the previous record was set in the first quarter of this year, when bankruptcy filings totalled 266,149. The second quarter figures pushed the total number of filings in the 12-month period ended June 30, 1996, to more than one million, reaching 1,042,110. "Today's bankruptcy boom is the natural result of three years of sustained consumer spending increases that far outpaced income growth," said Sam Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute. Personal bankruptcies accounted for 95.3 percent of the total number of filings in the second quarter.
