Hitachi Zosen Corp said on Thursday that it had won an order from Indonesia's state electricity firm for the construction of two 1,100-kilowatt diesel power generators. A Hitachi Zosen spokesman declined to disclose the cost of the project awarded by PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). The facilities will be built on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with one starting operations in August 1997 and the other in October the same year. This is the second order for a power generator which Hitachi Zosen has won from PLN, after one in 1987.
