A Russian airliner carrying 129 passengers and a crew of 12 crashed on Norway's Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday, the national news agency NTB said.   NTB said the wreckage of the Vnukovo Airlines Tupolev 154 had been found between the Helvetia and Opera mountains 10 km (six miles) east of Longyearbyen airport. "We have established a plane crash," spokesman Finn Bjoernar Hansen at the north Norway Bodoe rescue centre told Norwegian radio. "That is all we know now. We have started an extensive rescue operation. We have made contact with Russian authorities through the Foreign Ministry in Oslo for a Russian contact person to be made available on Spitzbergen." An ambulance helicopter was headed for the crash site, Hansen said. Tromsoe hospital on mainland Norway was put on full alert, the radio said.
