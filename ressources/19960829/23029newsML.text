The Broken Hill Pty Ltd (BHP) said on Thursday it had secured extensions of agreements with redeemable preference shareholders in Beswick Pty Ltd, a special purpose vehicle that holds a 17.1 percent stake in BHP.   BHP owns call options over Beswick 'A' and 'B' class redeemable preference shares currently held by Westpac Banking Corp and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The shares have a total face value of A$1.49 billion. BHP has agreed not to exercise its call on the 'A' shares before 2001 and the 'B' shares before September 2000. "Basically (to exercise the options) would require a use of capital that doesn't meet our hurdle rates at this stage," a BHP spokesman told Reuters. CBA and Westpac, in turn, have agreed not to redeem the 'A' shares before 2001.   Westpac also has agreed not to execise a put option which it holds over the 'B' shares, in which it has a 100 percent stake, before September 2000. In February 1988, Beswick issued 'A' shares to BHP and 'B' shares to Foster's Brewing Group Ltd which was known as Elders IXL Ltd at the time. BHP sold the 'A' shares to CBA and Westpac in 1992 and 1993, while Foster's sold an interest in the 'B' shares to Westpac in 1989. -- Melbourne Bureau 61-3 9286-1435
