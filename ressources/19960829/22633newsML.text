The number of Americans filing first-time claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 4,000 last week, climbing for the fourth consecutive week, the Labour Department said Thursday. New filings rose to 331,000 in the week ended Aug. 24 from 327,000 in the prior week. Wall Street economists had forecast 330,000 initial claims. The four-week moving average, which levels out the more-volatile weekly figures, totalled 323,250, up 9,250 from the previous week's 314,000. The average is considered a more accurate measurement of employment trends. The total of those receiving ongoing benefits rose 19,000 to 2.525 million in the week ended Aug. 17, the latest period for which those figures were available. That compared with 2.506 million in the prior week. One state reported an increase in initial claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended Aug. 17, the latest period for which the data were available, the department said. Delaware reported 1,643 new claims, citing layoffs in the automobile industry. Three states reported decreases in initial claims exceeding 1,000, on an unadjusted basis, in the Aug. 17 week. They were California, with 6,886 fewer claims, Illinois with 1,369 and Virginia with 1,095. California cited fewer layoffs in the service industry and agriculture, while Illinois had fewer layoffs in the trade and service industries, and manufacturing. Virginia gave no reason.
