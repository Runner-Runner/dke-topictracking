China's state-owned banks are setting up too many branches and creating too much competition for deposits, an official newspaper said on Thursday. The proliferation of bank branches was impeding the central bank's overall financial sector planning and making it harder for banks to make money, the Legal Daily said in a commentary. The newspaper also criticised banks for luring depositors with gifts that were wasting money. It added that depositors were opening up accounts at different banks just to collect gifts. It also said that the competition was in effect allowing banks to circumvent restrictions on interest rates. China's central bank sets interest rates for the nation's domestic commercial banks which are supposed to offer rates at a uniform level.
