Colombian closed lower after Banco Ganadero was battered by profit-taking for the second consecutive day. Bogota's IBB dropped 1.23 percent, ending at 832.17 on a volume of 2.4 billion pesos. Medellin's IBOMED general price index edged down 0.10 percent to close at 13,203.65 on a volume of 1.5 billion pesos. Brokers said Ganadero continued to be hit by a wave of profit-taking after Tuesday's public share sale, held to cement the bank's merger with Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizacaya.   The bank's stock surged in recent weeks on trading that pushed up the issue to the price of the public share sale. Ganadero's ordinary shares fell 6.42 percent in Bogota to close at 262 pesos per share. In Medellin, they plunged 8.81 percent, ending the day at 269 pesos a share. As Ganadero, the country's No. 1 bank in terms of assets, continued to lose ground, Banco de Colombia, the No. 2 bank, moved higher for the second consecutive day.   More than one billion pesos of Banco de Colombia shares traded hands in Bogota, where it closed up 0.71 percent at 425 pesos per share. In Medellin, the bank's stock rose 1.66 percent, ending at 427 pesos per share. One broker attributed the rise to cross-trades fueled by talk that Banco de Colombia was preparing to announce a big dividend payout at a shareholder meeting set for Sept. 27. Other gainers Thursday included Banco Industrial Colombia, which extended its previous day's gains by rising another 5.93 percent in Bogota to end at 3,570 pesos per share. It rose 1.42 percent in Medellin where it closed at 3,550. -- Javier Mozzo, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
