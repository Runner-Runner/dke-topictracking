Guatemala said Thursday it would immediately impose a 38.72 percent anti-dumping tariff on Cruz Azul cement imported from Mexico. "The dumping margin established is 38.72 percent, which establishes a provisional anti-dumping right to correct the unfair trade practice," Juan Mauricio Wurmser, minister of economy, said in a press release. Wurmser said an investigation during the second half of 1995 determined Cruz Azul cement was sold in Guatemala at much lower wholesale prices than cement sold in Mexico.   According to the minister, imports of Cruz Azul cement increased from 0.15 percent to 32.65 percent of Guatemalan national cement production during six months in 1995. During the same period, 91 percent of cement imported by Guatemala came from Cruz Azul. The minister said Guatemala was applying anti-dumping procedures established by the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Wurmser said that despite the cheap cement entering Guatemala, the price to Guatemalan did not fall. But the unfair competition at the wholesale level forced one Guatemalan cement manufacturer to halt most of its production, the minister said. That manufacturer, Cementos Progreso, initiated the investigation with a complaint to the government more than a year ago. Wurmser said the government will apply the tariff during a four-month period. The import duty will be modified or eliminated if the price difference drops to within two percent more than the price in the Mexican market. --Fiona Ortiz, Guatemala City bureau, +502 251-5718
