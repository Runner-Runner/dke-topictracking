All months of Tokyo corn futures closed lower on Thursday, as local investors were discouraged by weaker sentiment of Chicago corn futures overnight. Prices were 70 to 180 yen lower, with the benchmark September down 70 yen at 18,330 yen per tonne. Daily volume was 48,870 lots. All contracts fell from the opening session, due to selling orders from local investors and commodity brokers, traders said. "Some months recovered later on light technical buying, but a bearish mood remained throughout the day," a brokerage house trader said.   The spot September contract on the CBOT Project A trading system was being traded at $3.67 per bushel at 0835 GMT against $3.67-3/4 at Wednesday's close. The September contract on the CBOT soybean project A trading system was being traded at $8.18 at the same time, against $8.17 at Wednesday's close.
