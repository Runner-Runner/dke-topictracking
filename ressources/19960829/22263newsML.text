Strength on futures market again lifted U.S. spot products prices on Thursday, industry sources said, amid relatively quiet dealings. Absolute prices did indeed soar, with most products gaining more than 1.75 cents a gallon from late Wednesday's levels. The gains were sparked by a rally on NYMEX and on the IPE, where buyers of distilllates -- heating oil and gas oil -- were abundant and hungry. Low stocks and another week of disappointing U.S. inventory data supported the market, they said. Gasoline rose in line with crude oil and heating oil. But the frenzied pace was limited to the exchanges. Cash market traders said dealings had slowed to a crawl and that few players were expected to adjust position before the long Holiday weekend. NYMEX will be closed on Monday in observance of the U.S. Labor Day holiday. Cash market differentials mirrored levels seen on Wednesday. In New York Harbor, prompt heating oil was still for sale at 0.10 cent under the the September NYMEX print. Prompt reformulated gasoline diffs were also steady, with buyers reluctant ahead of the Sept products expiry on Friday. -- Franklin Paul, New York Energy Desk +1 212 859 1620
