A Chinese telecommunications satellite company will use a Long March rocket to launch a telecommunications satellite in late 1997, the official China Daily said on Thursday. The announcement comes less than two weeks after a Long March series rocket placed $120 million Chinese satellite in the wrong orbit, leaving it drifting hopelessly in space. "There is no plan to switch to other rocket carriers," the newspaper quoted Hao Weimin, president of China Orient Telecommunications Satellite Co Ltd, as saying. China Orient had signed a deal with China Great Wall Industry Corp to put the CHINASTAR-1 satellite into orbit between September and November next year, Hao said, adding that a final launch date had yet to be set. The satellite, which China Orient bought from Lockheed Martin Corp of the United States, will carry 48 Ku-band transponders and would provide telecommunications service to China and southern and western Asia, the newspaper said. China's space industry has been plagued by a recent string of failures.   On August 18, a Long March 3 rocket failed to place the U.S.-made Chinasat-7 telecommunications satellite in its proper orbit. The cause of the failure is still under investigation. In February, the launch of a Long March 3B rocket ended in disaster when it blew up seconds after liftoff, showery fiery debris over a wide area killing six people, injuring 57 and destroying an Intelsat satellite. In January 1995, a Long March carrier exploded, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite, also killing six people.
