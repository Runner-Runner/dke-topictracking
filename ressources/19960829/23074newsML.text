Shopping centre operator Westfield Holdings Ltd said on Thursday it expected increased profits in the 1996/97 year ending June 30 after announcing a 22 percent jump in 1995/96 net profit.   "1996 was a significant year for Westfield in which we continued our strong profit performance. We expect another good year with increased profit in 1996/97," Westfield managing director David Lowy said in a statement. Westfield said the rise in net profit to A$74.9 million from A$61.4 million in 1994/95. Lowy said the 1996 profit rise reflected the continuation of the company's growth in Australia and in the United States. This growth was underpinned by all facets of Westfield's business activities.   Lowy said a highlight of the year was the establishment of the Westfield America Trust, which floated in July in a A$790 million offering. The trust owns 67.2 percent of the U.S.-based Centermark shopping mall group. Westfield Holdings has a 29.7 percent stake in Westfield America. Lowy said demand for space in Westfield shopping centres remained strong despite the difficult retail trading conditiosn currently being experienced in Australia.   "This demand provides a solid basis for Westfield's future development porgramme, which is primarily determined by the anticipated space requirements of retailers," he said. Plans were underway for a number of other redevelopment projects in the United States which were expected to begin in later years. Lowy said retail conditions were showing signs of improvement in the United States. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
