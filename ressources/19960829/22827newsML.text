German chemicals group BASF AG said on Thursday it planned to sell its oilfield chemicals business to a unit of U.S. oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc. BASF said the two companies had signed a letter of intent for the sale of the unit to Baker Hughes' Baker Performance Chemicals Inc (BPCI) subsidiary but that the the product lines would continue to be manufactured in BASF-owned plants. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. BASF said the deal would enhance the growth potential of its production sites in Germany and the U.S. through BPCI's sales network. The German chemical giant said Houston-based Baker Hughes could enhance its global market position by gaining access to BASF research and technology. "We are sure this transaction will significantly strengthen the position of BASF and BPCI in the oilfield chemicals market by merging sales and technical service forces with the chance to offer the industry a substantially extended product portfolio," Harald Koehl, head of BASF's specialty chemicals division, said in a statement. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
