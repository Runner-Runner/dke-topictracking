France said on Thursday it had sent home 88 Africans despite protests against a crackdown on illegal immigrants. The Interior Ministry said 35 Malians, 11 Senegalese, 12 Tunisians and 30 Zaireans -- 10 of them expelled from the Netherlands -- were aboard two chartered planes which left on Wednesday night. The government apparently waited until the flights had reached their destination to confirm they had taken off and disclose who was on board. The airliners, at least one of them a military plane, left from Evreux air base west of Paris after unionists and human rights activists had urged civilian pilots not to fly deportees. The air force Airbus A-310 flew to Mali and Senegal, the ministry said. The other plane, a Boeing 737, flew to Tunis and Kinshasa, refuelling on the way in Niger. French handling of the illegal immigration issue has taken centre stage since a controversial police raid on 300 African protesters, 10 of them on a hunger strike, who had been occupying a Paris church for two months in a symbolic protest. CIMADE, an organisation looking after immigrants, said three of the church protesters were on the latest deportation flights. This was not confirmed by the ministry. Four of the church protesters and 53 other Africans had been deported last week on a military aircraft. Thousands of demonstrators marched through Paris on Wednesday to demand that expulsion orders be repealed and immigration laws reviewed.
