The New Zealand share market ran out of momentum on Thursday, after starting strong, coming under selling pressure towards the close. "Trading was disappointing as it never showed the follow through of the big day yesterday. The sellers got the better of the market towards the end of the day and it closed rather damp," said Don Turkington at Cavill White. The top 40 index ended one point down at 2,239.54 on solid turnover of NZ$55.9 million. Tranz Rail continued to rise, following on from a strong performance in the US overnight.   "If it was not for the good performance of such middle sized stocks as Sky City and Air New Zealand, the NZSE40 index would have been down more than it was," Turkington said. "Telecom had a better day than the figures would suggest closing at NZ$6.98, but the bulk of the business was done at NZ$7.00 with very good business at NZ$13.95 million," he said. Brokers said Fletcher Paper was surprisingly strong, closing up three at NZ$2.83 after a pretty soft profit result yesterday. All the other Fletcher's stocks closed down. "It was surprising they were sold after the firm results yesterday," said Turkington.   Brokers said the market should continue to see plenty of action in the leaders. Providing Wall Street looks alright overnight, the market should bounce back up a little. -- Victoria Batchelor (64 4) 473 4278
