Housecall Medical Resources Inc., one of the nation's 10 largest home health care providers, Thursday warned of a net loss for the fourth quarter, causing its stock to lose more than 50 percent of its value. Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, which it had previously recommended as outperforming the market, to underperform. The stock fell $7.625 to $6.875 on Nasdaq at midday, where it was among the most active issues. The Atlanta-based company went public in April at $16 a share. Housecall said it expected a quarterly loss because of the failure of the company's non-Medicare infusion therapy, hospice and nursing services businesses to meet budgeted revenues. It also cited a limitation on Medicare reimbursement for certain services provided during the quarter. Wall Street had expected Housecall to earn 17 cents a share in its fourth quarter ended June 30. The company reported profits of $1.4 million, or 12 cents a share, on revenues of $53.7 million in the third quarter ended March 31. "We became aware of this situation in performing the company's year-end audit, and we are notifying our shareholders immediately," said George Shaunnessy, president and chief executive officer. "While we have a preliminary understanding as to the scope and magnitude of these difficulties, we want to assess completely the implications this has for Housecall." Housecall said it will have a much clearer understanding of its problems and its implications for fiscal 1997 when it reports financial results in about two weeks.
