Australian tyre manufacturer Bridgestone Australia Ltd said on Thursday it was seeking to form a joint venture company next year with Japanese automotive components manufacturer Toyoda Gosei Co Ltd. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), Bridgestone said it was proposed that the new company would acquire assets and liabilities of Bridgestone Australia's automotive compnents division for their net commercial value. "The new company would be 60 percent owned by Bridgestone Australia and 40 percent by Toyoda Gosei," the statement said. Bridgestone said it was intended the joint venture company would operate from Bridgestone's existing plant at Edwardstown in South Australia and be jointly managed by the two companies. Toyoda Gosei makes a range of rubber and plastic automotive components which complement those made by Bridgestone Australia. Bridgestone Australia said the proposals were subject to regulatory approval and the approval of its minority shareholders which was expected to be sought by mid-December. Bridgestone Australia is 60 percent owned by Bridgestone Corp of Japan. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
