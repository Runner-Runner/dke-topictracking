State-owned German post office Deutsche Post AG said on Thursday it expected its ordinary business profit to be similar this year to the 364 million marks ($246.7 million) it made in 1995. Chairman Klaus Zumwinkel told the company's annual results conference: "We see a similar result this year despite an investment volume of 2.7 billion marks." He said the first eight months of the year had seen steady turnover although some areas like catalogue deliveries were experiencing problems related to sluggish developments in the economy. Zumwinkel said that with a similar operating profit to that of 1995, the company would be able to show a net profit this year because its transfer of 1.5 billion marks to state coffers in 1995 was the last such payment due to restructuring of the Post prior to a planned privatisation. In 1995 the transfer left Post with a loss of 1.16 billion marks. The company provided detailed figures of its 1995 results at the news conference. It had already said its ordinary business result was around 360 million marks, up from 257 million the year before. Turnover last year rose slightly to 28.57 billion marks from 28.37 billion in 1994. At the end of 1995 Post employed 307,400, a reduction of over 70,000 in the last five years. The cuts are part of Post's restructuring with the aim of privatising it towards the end of the decade. Post and its sister agency were reorganised into joint stock companies in 1995 but all the shares are still owned by the government prior to eventual privatisation. Post is likely to take a stake in Postbank in 1999. ($ = 1.475 German Marks)
