The Israel Corp has raised its stake in its subsidiary Piryon Investment Trust Co to 90 percent and may issue another offer to buy the remaining shares, the company said in a statement. In a statement to the Tel Aviv stock exchange, the diversified company said it had bought 670,149.60 shares and a company spokesman said the deal was worth nearly 65 million shekels. The company bought 98.98 percent of the shares offered by each seller, it said. The Israel Corp also said it had reached an agreement with the Industrial Development Bank of Israel for $27.5 million worth of credit for the period of up to one year to help finance the purchase. Earlier this month the company issued an offer to purchase 49.9 percent of shares of its subsidiary at a price of 95 shekels per share instead of 70.27 shekels per share at which price the company was trading on August 11, when the offer was made. Before the purchase Israel Corp held 50.1 percent of Piryon. Meir Hadar, managing director of YLR Underwriting, the investment banker for the deal, had said the deal was meant to cut costs by avoiding that both the Israel Corp and its subsidiary be holding companies. The Israel Corp is one of Israel's leading holding companies. ($1= 3.14 shekels). - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
