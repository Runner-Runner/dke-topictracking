Advance Bank Australia Ltd sees difficult times ahead, chairman Jim Service said on Thursday. "The next few years are going to be difficult and challenging in achieving our objectives," Service told the annual meeting.   In July, Advance Bank reported a 52.6 percent rise in its net profit to A$182.75 million. Later in the meeting, Service said the bank's directors were not prepared to make a forecast of Advance's earnings for the year to May 31, 1997. "The extent of the competition in both the housing loan and business loan markets is unpredictable at the moment," he said. "We know it can be extreme but how extreme we don't know yet and that has an impact." Service said the bank's results for the first two months of its 1996/97 financial year were not worrying.   "I haven't jumped off the Harbour Bridge having seen those (figures)," he said. Advance Bank shares closed six cents higher at A$5.50. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
