China will suspend projects involving fixed-asset investment of two million yuan ($241,000) or more if they fail to register with the local statistics bureaux by January 1, 1997, newspapers said on Thursday. Authorities would freeze the assets of projects which failed to register by the start of 1997, the China Daily and the Financial News said, quoting rules introduced by the State Statistics Bureau and the State Planning Commission. The regulations were part of a bid to gather more precise statistical data on fixed-asset investment, it said. Many smaller projects had escaped the notice of statistics agencies, resulting in inaccurate and misleading figures on the scale of fixed-asset investment, the Xinhua news agency said.
