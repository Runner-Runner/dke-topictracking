Nicaraguan coffee production is threatened by the government's failure to repair roads and bridges damaged by Hurricane Cesar, the president of Nicaragua's coffee growers union (Unicafe) said on Thursday. "If the Ministry of Construction does not respond rapidly to fix the roads, Nicaragua's coffee production is in danger," David Robleto told Reuters. Hurricane Cesar struck Nicaragua on July 28, washing out 297 miles (475 kms) of roads and nine bridges in the coffee growing regions of Matagalpa and Jinotega in north-central Nicaragua, he said. Robleto said the 600,000 quintales, or 100-pound (46-kg) bags, of coffee grown in the region are in danger of being lost because the government still has not repaired the roads and bridges. Unicafe projected Nicaragua's 1996-97 coffee production will be 1,071,649 quintales, a 10.8 percent drop over the previous coffee cycle. --David Koop, Managua bureau, (505) 266-3300
