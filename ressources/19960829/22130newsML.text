A distillate-led rally on futures markets pushed prices higher on cash products market late on Thursday, despite slow dealings, traders said. Heating oil prices jumped by more than 1.50 cents a gallon this afternoon tracking soaring NYMEX heating oil and IPE gas oil gains. The distillates were in great demand on both sides of the Atlantic due to thin stocks, despite the fact that the peak demand season is still months away. Gasoline rose in line with firm crude oil and heating oil. But the frenzied pace was generally limited to the futures excahnges. Cash market traders said dealings had slowed to a crawl and that few players were expected to adjust position before the long Holiday weekend. NYMEX will be closed on Monday in observance of the U.S. Labor Day holiday. Cash market differentials mirrored levels seen on Wednesday. In New York Harbor, prompt heating oil was still for sale at 0.10 cent under the the September NYMEX print. Prompt reformulated gasoline diffs were also steady, with buyers reluctant ahead of the Sept products expiry on Friday. -- Franklin Paul, New York Energy Desk +1 212 859 1620
