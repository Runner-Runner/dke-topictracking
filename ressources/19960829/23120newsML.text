------------------------- Aug 29 ---------------------------- 	  * More buying seen on Friday ------------------------------------------------------------- Manila shares finished higher on Thursday after a tentative start as foreign investors started buying up the market, traders said. The main index climbed 14.81 points to 3,215.79 following Wednesday's 4.59-point gain. "We're looking at an improved macro-environment," said Peter Mutuc, managing director of HG Asia Securities.   He said that the second quarter gross national product figure to be released next week may be higher than expected. Moreover, August inflation, which would be announced later next week, is projected to be lower, he said. Year-on-year inflation in July reached 8.9 percent. Paul de Vera, manager of Amsteel Securities, said there could be more positioning on Friday ahead of the announcement on GNP, which is tentatively scheduled on Monday. The market, however, could encounter resistance at 3,250 points, he said. - LILIAN KARUNUNGAN (632) 841-8937 Fax 8176267
