The Bank of Greece cut its intervention bid in overnight funds by 20 basis points to 12.40 percent, it said in a statement. "After taking into consideration the latest figures on M3 and credit expansion growth which show a marked slowdown, the central bank decided to slash its intervention bid in overnight funds by 20 basis points to 12.40 percent," a high-level central bank official told Reuters.   The M3 monetary aggregate grew provisionally by 8.3 percent year-on-year in July from 9.0 percent in June within the central bank's 6.0-9.0 target range and credit expansion slowed down to lie within the 5.0-7.0 percent target zone. The central bank cut its intervention bid in overnight money by 20 basis points to 12.60 percent last week on the back of Buba's hefty repo rate cut. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
