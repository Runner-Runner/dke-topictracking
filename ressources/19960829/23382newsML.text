Iberia said it plans to cash in on European Union air travel liberalisation next spring to launch Germany-Scandinavia services. Miguel Herter, Iberia cargo manager Germany, Austria and Scandinavia, said the airline plans a daily flight from Hamburg to Gothenburg and Helsinki. Under EU air liberalisation, all EU-based airlines will be able to fly between other EU member states from April 1997. "From summer 1997, Hamburg will be the Iberia hub for Scandinavia," Herter told Reuters in an interview. The new flight would be timed to meet the existing daily flight from Madrid via Barcelona to Hamburg, he added. He did not say which aircraft might be used on the Scandinavia route. Herter noted: "With this hub, we have five destinations with two aircraft. "If it succeeds, then other Scandinavian destinations and possibly the Baltic countries could be flown to from Hamburg." Herter pointed out that Iberia would be able to use fifth freedom rights to pick up both passengers and cargo in Hamburg for Spain or Scandinavia. "We would have much more presence. We would be able to operate cargo sales from Germany to Scandinavia," he said. The new Iberia Scandinavia service would compete with Deutsche Lufthansa AG and its partner Scandinavian Airline System to Gothenburg and with Lufthansa and Finnair to Helsinki, industry observers noted. Iberia currently has four services a week from Barcelona and Madrid to Stockholm and Copenhagen. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44-171-542-7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017
