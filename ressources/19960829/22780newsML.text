Germany's federal government deficit is likely to be at least 70 billion marks in 1996 and could run as high as 75 billion, well above the budgeted 60 billion marks, coalition sources said on Thursday. Higher-than-expected outlays for unemployment benefits due to the economic slowdown at the start of the year were the main reason for the higher deficit figure, the sources said. Tax revenues were also running lower than budgeted due to the higher unemployment, they said. On Wednesday the finance ministry finally admitted what many had predicted for some time -- that the deficit would exceed the planned 60 billion marks. Finance Minister Theo Waigel had been saying the opposite until Wednesday. The DIW economic research institute on Wednesday estimated the deficit would reach about 76 billion marks this year. The opposition Social Democrats say the deficit reached 57 billion in the first seven months of the year and will hit around 80 billion by year's end. The admission comes as a further embarrassment to Waigel who was forced to admit earlier this year that the total public deficit -- including that of states, local councils and social security funds -- jumped to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in 1995 from 2.6 percent the year before. Bonn is embarking on a programme of drastic spending cuts for next year to ensure it gets the deficit down to below three percent of GDP in 1997 -- the year on which suitability for EMU will be judged. Waigel says the spending cuts, combined with recovering economic growth, will be enough to reduce the deficit to around 2.5 percent next year. But with his earlier prediction of around 3.5 percent for this year now looking unachievable, financial markets are bound to question his budget figures for next year in the run up to economic and monetary union, just as they are for Germany's neighbour France.
