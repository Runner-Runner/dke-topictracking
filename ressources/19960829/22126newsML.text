U.S. West Coast light crudes continued at strong levels despite a slight drop off late Thursday, as WTI rallied on strength in heating oil. Heating oil for September delivery rose 1.63 cents a gallon to reach 63.67 cents during daytime trade. And that swayed the October crude oil market 44 cents a barrel higher to settle at $22.55, while spot WTI ranged $22.15/22.25, off from 22.20/22.30 a barrel earlier. Differentials for Alaska North Slope (ANS) stagnated at $2.05 a barrel off October WTI, with no deals seen until after the long U.S. holiday weekend.   One refiner reported increased buying interest for Kern River and other grades from San Juaquin Valley in California, which could raise discounts from current levels of 75 to 25 cents off posted prices. Refineries that had backed up heavy grades are more in balance now that most facilities are working following a problem-plagued summer, the refiner said. With the return of most refineries, West Coast margins are expected to ease, weighed also by typical weakness as gasoline consumption slows in the autumn. Kern River prices were idle at $14/14.50 a barrel. Wilmington also stagnated at 16.10/16.20 a barrel. A gas-making unit at Mobil's Torrance, refinery continued to experience problems, crude traders said, and no restart was in sight. A spokeswoman for Mobil declined comment. Line 63 differentials were unchanged at WTI minus $2.60/2.50 a barrel, with little trading seen ahead of mid-September. -- David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles +1 213 380 2014
