-- The Mexican brokerage house BBV-Probursa said it reiterated its buy recomendations on Grupo Corvi, Grupo Financiero Bancomer and Empresas ICA. -- Analyst Silvia Espinosa said GCorvi "represents an attractive investment" because of lower operating expenses that increased the company's operating margin to four percent in 1995 from one percent in 1993. -- BBV-Probursa sees GCorvi sales growing 9.6 percent in 1996 and 17 percent in 1997, which could reduce the GCorvi's debt by 70 percent.   -- Analyst Araceli Espinosa said of Grupo Financiero Bancomer, "The reduction in the growth of past-due loans, the strategic alliances and cheaper multiples ... permit us to reiterate our buy recommendation for GFB." -- Analyst Monica Lourdes de Leon said of construction giant ICA that "ICA is larger (and) more more diverse than other construction companies ... which is why we recommend a long-term buy." -- Despite a decline in 1996 second-quarter sales of 11.46 percent from the first quarter, ICA's dollar revenues have remained constant, the analyst said. -- Moreover, ICA is negotiating various contracts worth up to 7.1 billion pesos and the Transport Ministry plans to build 930 miles (1,500 km) of highways over the next four years, BBV-Probursa said. -- Patricia Lezama, Mexico City Newsroom (525) 728-9555
