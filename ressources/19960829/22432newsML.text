IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Thursday it had assigned long-term A minus and short-term A2 ratings to Zivnostenska Banka of the Czech Republic.   "Zivnostenska Banka (ZB) is the 6th largest bank in the Czech Republic and was the first to have Western European shareholders," IBCA said in a statement. ZB is presently owned by the Germany's BHF-BANK (47 percent), Credit Commercial de France (five percent), the IFC (10 percent) and various other institutional and private investors, it said. "Although ZB has retained its Czech character, it has benefited from BHF-Bank's advice and assistance with the development of credit and treasury risk management systems," IBCA said.   "Its loan portfolio has been expanded in a cautious fashion by concentrating on joint ventures between Western European and Czech companies and the stronger Czech corporates," it added. The agency said that ZB's loan loss provisioning requirements had been relatively low over the past few years, and the bank had built up a very high level of reserve coverage of its problem accounts. "The bank's capital ratios are relatively strong with total and tier one ratios of 12.5 percent and 11.5 percent at end-June 1996," IBCA said.   "ZB's long-term securities rating is the highest currently achievable by a Czech bank (IBCA's sovereign rating of the Czech Republic is A minus) and reflects its sound asset quality, liquidity and capital adequacy," IBCA said. -- Kate Kelland, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682
