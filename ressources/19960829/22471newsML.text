Daimler-Benz AG chairman Juergen Schrempp said the company might pay shareholders a dividend at the full-year stage if a positive earnings trend continues into the second half.   "If the second half continues along the same path or slightly better, the answer is obvious," Schrempp told a news conference. "We will go back to discuss dividends," he added. Daimler-Benz paid no dividend in 1995 when it reported a 5.7 billion mark loss. However, the conglomerate returned to the black in the first half of 1996, when it posted a net profit of 782 million marks compared with a 1.57 billion loss in 1995's first half. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
