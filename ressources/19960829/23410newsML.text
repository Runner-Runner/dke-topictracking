Denmark's central bank said on Thursday it offered to enter two-week state paper repurchase agreements at a fixed yield of 3.50 percent. The new rate followed automatically last Friday's trimming by the bank of the 14-day certificate of deposit (CD) rate to 3.50 percent from 3.70 percent. The bank steers money market rates and liquidity through its 14-day certificates of deposit (CDs) deals and state paper repos. The central bank discount and key deposit rates were unchanged at 3.25 percent. --Copenhagen newsroom, 45-33-969650
