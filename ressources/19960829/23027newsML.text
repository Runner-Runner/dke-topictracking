Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown said on Thursday he would oppose the government's plan to increase the Medicare levy for high-income earners who were not members of a private health fund. "I support an increased Medicare levy for high-income earners across the board, regardless of whether private health insurance is taken out," Brown said in a statement. He is one of two Green Senators who work in a loose coalition and whose votes may be needed by the government to get its enabling legislation for the Medicare levy surcharge through the upper House of parliament. "I will support amending the government's legislation in the Senate accordingly," Brown said. The one percent surcharge is to be imposed on people earning over A$50,000 each year but who are not members of a private health fund. The measure is forecast to raise upwards of A$60 million from 1998/99 (July/June). -- Canberra bureau 616-273-2730
