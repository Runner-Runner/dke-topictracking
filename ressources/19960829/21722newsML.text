Speciality Paperboard Inc. said Thursday it signed definitive agreements to buy Custom Papers Group Inc. and Arcon Coating Mills Inc., both manufacturers of speciality paper products. Financial terms were not disclosed and company officials could not be reached for comment. "Combined, they (the companies) will effectively double the gross revenues of our company," Brattleboro, Vt.-based Speciality Paperboard said. "They will also give us strong positions in several new speciality markets." Speciality Paperboard, which makes heavyweight pressboard used in offices and schools for such items as binders and file folders, said it would finance the acquisitions through a public offering of senior notes. The purchases of both closely held companies are expected to close by the end of the third quarter, it said. Custom Papers, a wholly owned subsidiary of CPG Investors Inc., operates five paper mills in Massachusetts, Michigan and New Jersey that were once part of James River Corp. Its products include filters for internal combustion engines, electrical insulating paper, mat boards for mounting pictures, sandpaper and photographic packaging materials. Arcon makes coloured binding and stripping tapes and edge cover materials used in checkbooks, bound books and office materials. It has annual revenues of about $28 million and has facilities in Oceanside, N.Y., and Springfield, Ohio. Speciality Paperboard's stock rose 75 cents to $15.25 on Nasdaq at midday.
