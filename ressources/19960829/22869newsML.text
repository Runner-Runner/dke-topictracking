Trading company Hagemeyer NV said on Thursday it did not believe its major shareholder First Pacific Co Ltd was behind recent heavy turnover in its shares. Group treasurer Dan Heyning said the company, about 37 percent owned by Hong Kong-based First Pacific, had noted that trading volume in the shares had been high but Hagemeyer was not aware who in particular had been buying. But he dismissed suggestions by some market analysts that First Pacific may have been lifting its stake, which was diluted from just above 50 percent through a takeover last year. "We have no reason to believe that they have been (buying). If they had, they would have told us," Heyning told Reuters. Turnover in the stock has increased in August to 600,000 shares on some days, compared with between 100,000 and 200,000 in the preceding months. The share price, which was 130.30 guilders at 0935 GMT, has risen from about 120.00 guilders since the start of this month and compared with less than 97.00 earlier this year. One dealer said there had been speculation that the Hong Kong shareholder had been a buyer in recent times. But other analysts said the buying may have been in expectation of a strong interim profit result, to be reported today. First Pacific's stake was diluted by the issue of Hagemeyer common shares to Borsumij Wehry shareholders as part of the 750 million guilder purchase of the trading group last October. But its voting interest was kept above the 50 percent level after preference shares were issued to institutions and First Pacific took the the voting rights on these shares. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
