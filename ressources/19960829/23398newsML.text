Austrian police said on Thursday they had made two further arrests in a child pornography investigation, taking the number of people held to three. In a statement, police said the men, aged 40 to 51, were being held on suspicion of producing pornographic material and sexually abusing children. Officers had seized a large quantity of video material from the Vienna home of one of the suspects. Police arrested a 45-year-old Austrian man on Tuesday and took the other two into custody on Wednesday night. All three live in the capital but police said one was a Polish citizen. Austrian weekly News magazine reported that the first man belonged to a pornography ring which provided clients in Vienna with a choice of 70 girls, largely from Slovakia, aged between seven and 13. Police declined to comment on whether there was a connection with a Belgian child pornography scandal in which the chief suspect, Marc Dutroux, has been named by police in Bratislava as suspected of murdering one Slovak woman and kidnapping another.
