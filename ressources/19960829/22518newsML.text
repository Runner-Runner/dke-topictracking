Shares in Mofet Israel Technology Fund soared the maximum 10 percent after the venture capital fund issued an announcement about two of its holdings. Mofet said U.S. Robotics Corp had concluded the purchase of Tel Aviv-based Scorpio Communications Ltd for $72 million. In a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Mofet said that before the sale it had converted bonds it held in Scorpio to shares and exercised the option to buy additional shares, bringing its stake in Scorpio to 7.5 percent.

Mofet will realise a pretax profit of 10 million shekels on the sale, the company said. Separately, Mofet said Orchit Communications, in which it holds 4.3 percent, had filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of about 3.3 million shares.
