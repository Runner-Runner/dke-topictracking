Trade in the New Zealand dollar was almost completely becalmed on Thursday due to a lack of interest, the currency drifting loosely in line with the Australian dollar. "It's dead as a doornail," said one Auckland dealer. "There's almost a complete lack of interest," he said. The currency finished at US$0.6922/29, unchanged from the opening, after trading a 0.6924-32 range on the day. The Trade-Weighted Index eased back to 65.47 from 65.51. More of the same is expected overnight, the currency likely to trade in a US$0.6915-35 band. -- James Gray (64 4 4714 279)
