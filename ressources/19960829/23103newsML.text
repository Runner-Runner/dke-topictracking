Up to 50 freight trains, carrying A$50-60 million worth of commodities, were being held up on Australia's national lines on Thursday by striking workers, the Public Transport Union (PTU) said. PTU official John Crossing told Reuters the strike by South Australian employees of Australian National, the federal government owned rail system, had also stopped services run by the government's interstate freight service, the National Rail Corp. Private interstate freight operators TNT and Specialised Container Traffic (SPT) were also affected, he said.   Crossing said workers were protesting refusal by the Australian government to respond to concerns about the future of AN, which operates in South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, amid speculation services could be closed down or privatised. "This is the first shot at trying to get some sense to prevail from this government," he said. Crossing would not rule out further industrial action, saying he believed workers would not be too hesitant to continue the dispute over time if the government continued to procrastinate on consultations.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
