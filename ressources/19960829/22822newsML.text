Denmark's central bank said on Thursday its monthly treasury bill auction resulted in minimum rates of 3.63 percent for the four-month series and 3.70 percent for the seven-month series. One month ago the four-month series, then with a maturity of five months, yielded 3.84 percent, with the other series, at that time with eight-month maturity, yielding 3.92 percent. The central bank said it sold 2.2 billion crowns worth of the four-month series and 2.15 billion crowns worth of the seven-month series, giving a total of 4.35 billion crowns for both series. --Chris Follett, Copenhagen newsroom +45-33-969652
