The German farm ministry in a statement on Thursday said the EU area devoted to the production of oilseeds for food uses should be 4.7 million hectares this year, below the 4.9 million Blair House limit. This confirmed estimates earlier this year by EU oilseeds traders and producers. The EU-15 limit is 5.48 million ha, from which 10 percent set-aside is deducted, giving an effective ceiling of 4.93 million. Some 700,000 hectares were planted to industrial crops in the EU-15, bringing the total area to 5.4 million hectares, down 3.6 percent from 1995, the ministry said. It also said yield expectations were down and oilseeds production should be lower than last year. Oilseeds lobby ANGO on July 12 put the total 1996 crop at 12.24 million tonnes, down from 12.61 million tonnes last year, which included 8.26 million tonnes of rapeseed. The German statement was part of a set of national harvest statistics issued today. -Bonn newsroom, +49-228-26097146
