NWE oil products leaped on futures gains, but prices were more notional with end-user demand seen only for fuel oil, dealers said. Gasoline was offered at $206 fob ARA, up $2 a tonne. Traders said one major was a possible bidder at $204. Gas oil futures were $2.75 firmer, having earlier risen by over $5. Early September deliveries were offered at a high premium of Sept +$2, but the strength of the IPE left no buyers. High sulphur fuel oil barges traded three times at $100, a gain of about $3 a tonne. Bunker demand was fair. -- Philip Blenkinsop, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000
