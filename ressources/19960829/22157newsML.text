Cost Plus Inc said Alan Zimtbaum was named president and chief operating officer, two new positions created in response to the diminished health of chairman and chief executive Ralph Dillon. Zimtbaum will also continue his duties as chief financial officer. Dillon said in a statement that he has a diminished kidney function that may limit the performance of his corporate duties. The company said, however, that Dillon remains chairman and chief executive and will "actively continue his role overseeing the company's operations." Cost Plus also named Dennis Daugherty to the new position of executive vice president of operations, where he will oversee the distribution and management information systems areas of the company. Zimtbaum joined Cost Plus in 1990 as executive vice president of finance, and chief financial officer. Daugherty joined the company in 1990 as vice president of distribution and logistics.
