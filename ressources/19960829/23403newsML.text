German chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Wednesday that Europe's planned common currency must be introduced but that the launch must not be the result of political compromise. Speaking at a private celebration in honour of Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer's 65th birthday, Kohl said, "The Euro must come but there should be no feeble compromises." Kohl's comments were summarised to news agencies by a Bundesbank spokesman in a telephone conference. The spokesman also quoted Tietmeyer as saying he backed European integration but warning that the basis must be right. "I wholeheartedly back the integration, but the foundations must be the right ones," Tietmeyer was quoted as saying. To secure the durability of the currency union, scheduled to begin with member nations which meet a list of entry criteria on January 1, 1999, Tietmeyer urged that an additional set of rules enforcing fiscal austerity be adopted. "I hope the stability pact will become a basis for the currency union," Tietmeyer said, adding such a set of rules, seeking to punish nations which stray in fiscal matters, would enhance the union's credibility among markets and citizens.
