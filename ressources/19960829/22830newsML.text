France is in a period of deflation, bringing with it grave implications for social and economic policies, former finance minister Alain Madelin said on Thursday in an article in the Le Monde newspaper. "For my part, I have been trying for nearly four years now to show the deflationary pressure on our economy and to propose a suitable policy," he wrote. Madelin resigned from the conservative government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe in August last year, after clashing over the speed and scope of financial reforms. His departure prompted scepticism over the government's desire for fundamental change.   Madelin, considered a strong advocate of free-market economics, said deflation was a heavy drag on the economy. He added supply-side measures were required rather than measures to stimulated demand. Greater deregulation, more privatisations and reform of the state were needed. Interest rates should be cut to as near to zero as possible, just as the United States did in 1991 and Japan in 1995, he said. The Bank of France on August 22 cut its intervention rate by 20 basis points to 3.35 percent following an easing by the Bundesbank. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452 pnt
