The Chinese yuan closed up at 8.3066 against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, from Wednesday's 8.3087, on the Shanghai-based interbank foreign exchange market. The yuan opened up at an intra-day low of 8.3070 and consolidated between 8.3062 and 8.3066 for most of the session, hitting an intra-day high of 8.3058 in the mid-session. Trading was dull with most done at 8.3064, traders said. Dealers said the yuan rebounded today because most investors thought its trend was still unclear following yesterday's fall.   "The yuan stopped dropping after yesterday's large loss, and sellers hesitated to go on pushing it down," said one dealer. Dealers expected the yuan would move stably around 8.3070 on Friday. The yuan closed up slightly at 7.6525 from 7.6601 against 100 Japanese yen, and down at 1.0745 from 1.0735 against the Hong Kong dollar. --Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004
