Shares in viscose fibre maker Lenzing slumped to a new year low in Vienna on Thursday after the firm reported a first half loss and held out little hope of an improvement by year end. At 0915 GMT Lenzing shares were 4.2 schillings down at 672, having dropped to 600 schillings when they resumed trading at 0900 GMT. "But volume was very thin. I would expect a decline of a maximum three to four percent today," said a trader. Market watchers said Lenzing's first half loss was in line with expectations. "But comments about the second half are hardly positive," one noted. Lenzing forecast a second half loss of roughly the same size as the first half. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254
