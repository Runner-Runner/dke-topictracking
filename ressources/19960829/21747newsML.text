Though the dollar ended virtually unchanged from Wednesday versus the mark and the yen, analysts said it may have found a higher floor and be ready to attack some good resistance levels. The dollar ended on Thursday in New York at 1.4767/74 marks versus 1.4765/70 on Wednesday, and at 108.37/47 yen vs. 108.42/49. The U.S. currency is eyeing a first resistance at 108.50/55 yen -- the high set on Wednesday following the release of a weak Japanese Beige Book -- and then at 108.75 yen, the level that would signal a breakout, analysts said.   "Dollar/mark may break through 1.4820 resistance," one technical analyst at a European bank said. "I can't rule out a break through 1.4730/35, a big support, but that level has been holding without problem so far," he added. "Though we closed dollar/mark at virtually the same levels as on Wednesday, the high for the day today were higher than yesterday and the lows were higher as well." Dollar/mark set a session's high in New York at 1.4815 on Thursday vs. 1.4792 on Wednesday, while the low was 1.4760 vs. 1.4735. "It may be a signal for the bulls," the analyst noted.   But analysts said much of the dollar's fate may be tied to the performance of mark/Paris. A brush on Thursday with a key psychological level at 3.4305 -- the top of the old European Rate Mechanism band -- was followed by reports the Bank of France had intervened to rescue its currency versus the mark. As usual, the Bank of France did not deny or confirm the reports that quoted traders. "We're looking at the 38-percent Fibonacci retracement of the big mark/Paris move between October (1995) and April," the analyst said while putting that level at 3.4350/60.   Beside the psychological importance of the old ERM top, mark/Paris also is near a key technical level at 3.4285 which is a 10-month, 50-percent retracement level, analysts also said. Sharp mark gains vs. the French franc or vs. European high yielders would weight on the dollar and cap its upside, they added. -- Isabelle Clary, 212-859-1666
