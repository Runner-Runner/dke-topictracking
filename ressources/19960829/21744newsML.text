North Carolina, the nation's leading tobacco-growing state, plans to sue to halt the federal government from regulating tobacco as a drug, the attorney general's office said Thursday. The move follows President Clinton's approval last week enabling the Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine as a drug with the intent of stopping sales of tobacco to minors. "The people of this state, including tobacco farmers, agree that we need to stop kids from smoking," state Attorney General Mike Easley said in a statement. "We just disagree with the FDA on the best way to accomplish this goal." North Carolina's cash receipts for tobacco in 1995 totalled $1.05 billion, according to the state Department of Agriculture, and thousands of small farms in the state grow the crop. Easley was not specific about what legal steps the state would take. He said a final decision would be made as soon as possible but that one was not likely before next week. If the state does not file its own lawsuit, then it could join others to oppose the new regulations by the FDA, officials said. Last week, Kentucky, another big tobacco state, said it would sue to bar FDA regulation of tobacco. Some constitutional law professors have likened the lawsuits to grandstanding as state politicians have said they must assure farmers. "North Carolina is in a sensitive position for politicians because tobacco is a significant portion of our economy," said Democratic State Sen. Frank Ballance, the majority whip, "thus it's appropriate that politicians pay attention to this and that's what the governor's doing." Gov. Jim Hunt is running for re-election. His Republican opponent, Robin Hayes, has also vowed to fight what he called President Clinton's war on tobacco.
