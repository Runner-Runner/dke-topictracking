The Philippines' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has lifted suspension orders on three commodity futures brokerage houses, SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay said on Thursday. Yasay, however, clarified that the lifting does not allow the firms to resume trading operation, but only gives them the opportunity to liquidate open positions of their clients. The SEC issued on June 23 a cease-and-desist order on the Manila International Futures Exchange (MIFE) and six of its brokerage houses on reports of widespread irregularities in the exchange. It has since lifted the order on MIFE and directed it to reform the market. The other three brokers are still under investigation. The exchange offered futures contracts in copra, sugar, dry cocoon, soybeans, coffee and major currencies, but trading volumes were negligible. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
