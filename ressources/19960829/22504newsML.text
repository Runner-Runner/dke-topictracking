Rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq agreed on Thursday to attend U.S.-sponsored peace talks in London aimed at cementing a ceasefire between them. "The party has agreed to attend peace talks in London tomorrow to meet with U.S. officials," the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said in a statement. The rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said it would also take part in the talks, which follow a ceasefire agreement on Wednesday morning to end recent fighting which has killed scores of people. "These are preliminary talks aimed at strengthening the ceasefire on the initiative of U.S. negotiators," PUK spokesman Latif Rashid told Reuters by phone from London. The British foreign office welcomed the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and urged the two factions to respect it. "We fully support those (U.S.) efforts and have reiterated our willingness to help with a meeting in London if this would contribute towards reaching a substantive peace agreement," it said in a statement in London. A previous U.S.-brokered ceasefire last Friday was broken by sporadic fighting. There were no reports of new clashes on Thursday, but KDP spokesman Dilshad Miran said the PUK, supported by Iranian artillery, had violated the ceasefire with an attack on Wednesday. Friday's preliminary talks are aimed at pushing forward agreements early last year which put an end to more than a year of clashes in which about 3,000 people died. Previous talks have centred on the distribution of oil trade revenues and the status of the city of Arbil, which is currently under PUK control. U.S., British and French planes have been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq since shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 to shield Iraq's Kurds from attack by the Baghdad government. Both Iraqi Kurd factions have expressed concern about the build-up of Iraqi troops near Kurdish regions in recent days.
