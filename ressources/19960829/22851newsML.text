Portuguese state-owned airline TAP-Air Portugal said it made a first-half loss of 12.3 billion escudos, bigger than the 11.3 billion loss originally forecast in the company's restructuring plan. A spokesman confirmed a report in the daily Diario Economico which attributed the losses to a slump in the number of tourists visiting Portugal this summer. During the same period last year TAP posted losses of 14.9 billion escudos. The company said it was too early to revise down its forecast for the whole year since July passenger numbers pointed to an increase in business after a very poor June. -- Lisbon editorial +(351-1) 3538254
