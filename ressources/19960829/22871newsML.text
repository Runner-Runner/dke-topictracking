Swedish telecoms group LM Ericsson AB said on Friday it had won a contract of unspecified value from an Indonesian joint venture to supply 50,000 lines of Ericsson's DRA 1900 cordless phone system. The PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia (MGTI) joint venture has a 15 year concession from the Indonesian telecoms authorities to run the telephone network in central Java. The DRA 1900 system links subscribers to the fixed telephone network via digital radio technology, Ericsson said in a statement. -- Stockholm newsroom, +46-8-700 1006
