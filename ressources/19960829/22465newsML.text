Scottish and Newcastle Plc said on Thursday it expects the UK's competition authorities to maintain a level playing field in the application of competition policy relating to the recent Carlsberg-Tetley brewing deal between Bass Plc and Allied Domecq.   "Your company does not see this as an extra threat to the future progress of Scottish Courage, nor would we be sensitive to the change of status to that of number two brewer in sales volume terms," Scottish and Newcastle chairman Sir Alick Rankin told shareholders at the group's annual meeting. "We have, today, the logistical structure, the brands, the depth of management and the market muscle to ensure success against any alignment," he added. Rankin said the group's three divisions, brewing, retailing and leisure each have "the resource and scope for strong organic growth", with brand development the dominant objective.   "Notwithstanding the uncertainties of European economics, we have identified our strengths and established our particular market positions and feel confident that these will deliver rewarding growth into the foreseeable future," he added. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
