U.S. shares were trading around the New York close in London ahead of a raft of economic data due to be released this afternoon, traders said. Second quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) and initial jobless claims for the week to August 24 are due at 1230 GMT. GDP is forecast at 4.2 percent, jobless claims at 330,000. July new home sales are due at 1400 GMT and are expected to decline slightly to 728,000. "We're waiting for a load of facts and figures from the government -- it usually goes a bit quiet ahead of that," said one London trader.   "There isn't a lot going on. Bonds are doing nothing and the futures index is about as undecided about which way the market's going as we are," he said. One of the few features in London was Philip Morris, up $1/2 to $91-3/4 as worries about U.S. tobacco litigation continued to ease. Shares in Boeing were also up $1/2 at $92-5/8 on a report in the Wall Street Journal that the company had secured orders from Asian carriers for more than 30 of its new, larger, long-range 747 jumbo jets valued at more than $5.5 billion.   The order could grow to as many as 50 planes, the newspaper said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8712
