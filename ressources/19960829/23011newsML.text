Cost savings from the merger of the European downstream assets of British Petroleum Co Plc and Mobil Corp could be higher than originally envisaged, Mobil chairman and chief executive Lucio Noto said in an interview with the Financial Times. The companies said they expected cost savings of $400 million to $500 million when they announced the merger plans in February. The Finanical Times said Noto declined to speculate on what the final figure might be, but that he said the two companies had identified "much more potential" for cost savings through asset rationalisation. Noto said in the interview that most of the cost savings should be realised next year from the merger, which will create a new $5 billion joint venture. "We won't trap the whole prize in 1997, but we hope to trap the bulk of it by then," Noto said. But he added that the extra cost savings would not necessarily mean further job cuts than the 3,000 or so predicted in February. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427717
