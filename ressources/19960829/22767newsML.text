Norway's Labour Directorate said on Thursday it saw signs of emerging local bottlenecks in the country's labour market. "Besides public health care, there is considerable tightness in the pulp and paper industry, furniture manufacturing and shipbuilding," said Ted Hanisch, head of Norway's Labour Directorate. "But besides that, I can see no serious bottleneck problems," he added. The country's unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent in August is among the lowest in Europe, and only about half that of its Scandinavian neighbours Sweden (8.4 per cent) and Denmark (8.7 per cent). One week ago, Statistics Norway announced employment growth of 68,000 people or about three percent year-on-year in the second quarter. Unemployment, however, shrank by only 17,000. Norway, which pumps about three million barrels of crude oil per day, is the world's largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. Director of research at Statistics Norway, Nils Martin Stoelen, said besides spending the country's oil revenues, factors behind the low unemployment were several years of successful wage deals and considerable supply-side flexibility in the labour market. "The capacity in Norway's education system has greatly increased over the last few years, and arrangements for early retirement have been very liberal, thus contributing to a lower unemployment rate," he said. But he added that there were limits to how fast employment could grow without spurring inflation. "A few years ago, a government study concluded that an employment rate of about 3.5 percent was compatible with non-accelerating inflation," said Stoelen. "But there is probably no reason to fear serious bottlenecks in the next year or two," he said. --John Eriksen, Oslo newsroom +47 22 93 69 73
