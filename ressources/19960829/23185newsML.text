Japan is likely to see its trade surplus decline moderately and gradually, a senior Japanese trade official told a news conference on Thursday. Hisashi Hosokawa, vice trade minister for international trade affairs, also said it was not the case that Japanese exports would rise dramatically just because of a weaker yen.   "The most moderate viewpoint is that the Japanese economy will probably experience a moderate and gradual decrease in the surplus," Hosokawa said. He added that this should not create problems for Japan, assuming that it could create new technologies and industries to provide employment opportunities. On exports, he said: "It is not the case that exports will increase dramatically just because the yen weakened." "There is no simplistic linkage between the weak yen and an increase in exports," he said.
