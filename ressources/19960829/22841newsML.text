Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Thursday the forthcoming privatisation of state telecoms company Stet could be approved in parliament with help from some opposition parties. Asked in an interview with Panorama magazine whether he found it "natural" for opposition groups to endorse the Stet sale, Prodi said: "Such parliamentary behaviour is completely consistent with the working of a bi-polar system." The interview was released ahead of publication. Prodi's centre-left Olive Tree coalition, which includes former communists, centrists and Greens, has a majority in the Senate (upper house) but relies on support from the hard left Communist Refoundation party in the lower Chamber of Deputies. Communist Refoundation has to date sided with the government in crucial votes but has strongly rejected the planned Stet sale for ideological reasons. The main opposition is Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right Freedom Alliance, comprising his own Forza Italia party, the far-right National Alliance (AN) and centrist parties. Outside the main blocs is the secessionist Northern League. The privatisation of Stet is set for Spring 1997 but parliament must first approve a controversial media and telecoms bill which will set up a watchdog for the phone sector. AN leader Gianfranco Fini said in an interview with Thursday's La Stampa that it was too early to say whether the centre-right Freedom Alliance would give the green light to the Stet sell-off. The Northern League has said it would be prepared to help pass the legislation needed for the Stet sale but wants Prodi to come to its self-proclaimed "parliament of the North" in Mantua to ask for help. -- Rome newsroom +396 678 2501
