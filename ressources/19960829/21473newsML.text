Argentine cash maize was mainly steady in slow trade at the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange Thursday midsession, with little supply on offer and little incentive for buyers to pay more, traders said. April cash maize was also steady in a directionless market. January wheat was unchanged in dull trade, with nerves over dry northern weather still about but buyers unwilling to up bids. May cash soybeans were steady in good volume, with buyers happy to take positions. Cash sunflower seed dipped in a slow spot market, with crushers taking a dislike to current prices. March sunseed rose, with buyer interest, but there was little supply. -- Jason Webb, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541 318-0655
