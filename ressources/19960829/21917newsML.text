New tranches of German intervention barley, opened up by the European Union earlier on Thursday, will become available from September, industry sources said. A first tranche of 150,000 tonnes will open for export on September 5 and the second trache one week later, they said. Traders have pressed the European Commission to put 300,000 tonnes of extra barley on sale to cover deals with Saudi Arabia. The Commission had previously offered to release an extra 150,000 tonnes but delayed a decision on this last week. The EU on Thursday sold 234,324 tonnes of German barley at some $145/tonne out of a remaining allocation of 283,000 tonnes.
