Automotive, electrical and industrial supplier Atkins Carlyle Ltd said in its annual report released on Thursday it expected a marginally better trading outlook for 1996/97 and was optimistic of higher earnings per share. "The trading outlook for 1997 appears to be marginally better than that experienced in 1996, although any noticeable change in demand is likely to materialise only in the latter part of the year," Atkins Carlyle Managing Director Kevin Clarke said in the report.   Atkins Carlyle's net profit for the year to May 31, 1996 fell 18 percent to A$7.5 million and earnings per share fell to 25.02 cents from 32.46 cents. "Another positive factor will be the expected turnaround of the loss makers which impacted the 1996 results," Clarke said. "We are optimistic that earnings per share should increase in 1997," he said. Clarke also said the company hoped to conclude at least one acquisition in a field related to its current activities over the next 12 months.   Atkins Carlyle's shares were untraded at 11.00 am (0100 GMT) from its A$3.50 close on Wednesday. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
