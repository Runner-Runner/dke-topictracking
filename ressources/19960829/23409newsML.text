German Bunds and futures were firmer in morning trade on Thursday despite overnight losses in U.S. markets, traders said. At 0735 GMT, DTB September Bund futures were up 11 basis points at 97.44 in moderate volumes. "A technically driven market is still determining the German rate futures," Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Futures & Options said in a market commentary. September futures have moved back into the key 97.35 to 98.05 range. Traders said the market will need to show good buying interest in this range for any upward advance.   But a lack of German fundamentals has limited market interest as the focus remains on the U.S. and the release of more economic data during afternoon European dealings. Scheduled for release are U.S. second quarter GDP data at 1230 GMT and new home sales at 1400 GMT. The market has in addition drawn support from speculation about a possible delay in European currency union. MMS International said in a market commentary that German debt was being viewed as a "safe haven" after Germany's Finance Ministry on Wednesday said Germany would not meet the target budget deficit of 60 billion marks for 1996.   The German debt market has also found an underpinning from similiar difficulties in France with seeking to comply with the criteria for currency union, MMS said. The lack of trading volume has sparked interest in the spread between 10-year Bunds and 5-year Bobls, which reached about 580 basis points in late trade on Wednesday. Some traders expected the spread to widen further to about 600 basis points. On a technical basis, September Bund futures were expected to trade within a range from 97.05 to 97.60 for the near-term and the lead Bobl futures contract between 103.00 and 103.35. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
