A northern Iraqi Kurdish group said on Thursday it had agreed to attend U.S.-sponsored peace talks in London with a rival Kurdish faction. "The party has agreed to attend peace talks in London tomorrow to meet with U.S. officials," the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said in a statement. It said the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan would also attend the talks, set for Friday.   The KDP said the peace talks were intended to solidify the latest ceasefire with the PUK, which went into effect on Wednesday morning, through stationing monitors on the ground. A previous U.S.-brokered ceasefire last Friday was broken by sporadic fighting. Friday's talks are designed to push forward agreements reached early last year which ended more than a year of clashes that cost around 3,000 lives. U.S., British and French planes have been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq since shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 to shield Iraq's Kurds from any attack by Iraqi troops.
