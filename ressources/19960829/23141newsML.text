Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) said in its budget plan that it hopes to issue a total of 22.88 trillion yen in new government bonds in fiscal 1997/98 starting next April, up from a planned 21.03 trillion yen this fiscal year, a ministry official said on Thursday. MOF has planned an overall budget of 21.34 trillion yen for itself for the next fiscal year, up from a planned 19.01 trillion yen for the current fiscal year. It has also requested an additional 12.8 trillion yen under a special framework in the 1997/98 state budget to finance public works projects and economic structural reforms.   A large part of the ministry's budget will be used to cover debt-servicing costs which are likely to total 18.27 trillion yen in 1997/98. Yields on the new bond issues are expected to be around 4.4 percent, the MOF official said. MOF has also allotted a budget of 31.45 trillion yen for refunding bonds next fiscal year, compared with a planned 26.56 trillion yen for this fiscal year. Final approval is expected to be given in December after negotiations between MOF and other ministries.
