Base metals miner Aberfoyle Ltd said its net profit fell to A$8.88 million in the year to June 30 from A$15.91 million a year earlier largely because of a big fall in the contribution from its Hellyer mine in Tasmania. Managing director Mike Eager said a higher exploration write-off and provision also contributed to the fall in profit. Hellyer's earnings before interest and tax were A$26.7 million compared to A$36.9 million last year, Eager said. Those earnings included a drop of A$1 million from $3.7 million to A$2.7 million in metal price and currency hedging gains from last year.   The cash cost of production at Hellyer was US$0.37 per pound of zinc this year compared to US$0.35 a year earlier. "The reduction in earnings was equally attributable to lower production and higher mining costs, much of the latter due to preparations for a mass blast at year end," Eager said. "Revenue factors were neutral with the effects of higher lead prices and lower treatment charges offset by adverse changes in zinc prices, hedging profits and exchange rates." Net foreign exchange losses not included in the Hellyer result totalled $A800,000 compared to a net profit of A$1.1 million last year.
