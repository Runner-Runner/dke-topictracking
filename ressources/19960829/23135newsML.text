The Taichung division of Taiwan's Breakfast Soybean Procurement Association bought two 54,000 tonnes shipments of U.S. soybeans on Friday, traders said.   The association's Taichung and Kaohsiung divisions moved up the schedule of their tenders to stay ahead of rising freight prices, traders said. "It's better to buy while freight prices are still low," a buyer in the Kaohsiung division said. Bunge supplied the first shipment and Cargill provided the second one, traders said.
