A senior investigator in the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange's (CSCE) compliance department was found dead in his Brooklyn, New York, apartment Tuesday, and the case was being treated as a homicide, the New York medical examiner's office said on Thursday. The victim, identified by the medical examiner as Romeo Williams, 30, was discovered by police on Tuesday afternoon handcuffed and weighted down in his bathtub. The official cause of death was suffocation and drowning, it said. A CSCE spokeswoman said Williams was a CSCE investigator but declined to comment on what cases he was working on. One trader on the floor of the CSCE said the media was "sensationalizing" the story and called talk that there was a possible connection between his job and death as "ridiculous." "He investigated minor infractions," said the trader. "Who's going to murder someone to avoid a $100 fine?" CSCE investigator duties include making sure floor traders keep trades in sequence and time stamps are correct, another trader said. More serious infractions are handed over to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the trader added. The CSCE said that Williams joined the exchange in 1987 as a junior reporter in the cocoa pit and had worked his way up to a senior position in the compliance department.
