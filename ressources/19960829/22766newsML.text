German chemicals giant Bayer AG said its business was strong but that more rationalisations were needed to eliminate weak spots within the corporate structure. Addressing executives and works council members from 30 different Bayer units in 15 different nations, Bayer management board chairman Manfred Schneider said business in Europe had grown more slowly than in other global reasons. Unfavourable cost structures, especially in Germany, were partly to blame that European growth lagged behind North American and Asian growth, Schneider told the group. Consequently the company needs to press on with cost-cutting measures, Schneider said, assuring however, "We will do everything possible to secure jobs in Europe and in Germany." The head of all worker councils, Rolf Nietzard, demanded a stop to the wave of job cuts, saying that works councils had agreed future reductions should be calibrated to reflect only the change in economic conditions. Over the past five years Bayer has cut its European workforce by about 12 percent to 94,300. The bulk of that reduction occurred in Germany where some 10,000 jobs were lost. But Bayer personnel director Hans-Juergen Mohr said Asia's growing importance at the expense of Europe's position for the company would force managers to continue concentrating more and more on core businesses, searching for potential synergies. "New plants will be largely built abroad, and in light of changed economic conditions, the pressure on jobs will not abate," Mohr said. --Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
