The Sri Lankan government has invited tenders to import 30,000 tonnes of rice to meet an anticipated shortfall in the local crop, hit by drought earlier this year, government officials said on Thursday. Tenders invited by the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment, the state buying arm, will close early next week, they said. It will be the first government import of rice for this year. The tender is for delivery in three lots of 10,000 tonnes each for the first week of September, October and November. Private traders imported more than 100,000 tonnes of rice in the first seven months of 1996, they said.
