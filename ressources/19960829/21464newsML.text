Ecuador's government has agreed to extend the bidding period for the sale of state telephone company Emetel in order to attract more investors, government officials said Thursday. Omar Quintana, president of the National Council for the Modernization of the State, said at a press conference the bidding will be extended by a month to October 30. "We will try to obtain the best price possible for the privatization of Emetel and therefore we will lengthen the bidding period," said Quintana.   The state has split Emetel into two companies for the privatization, with buyers able to buy up to 35 percent of each unit. "To sell a telephone company is no science because we all know that there are about 30 potential buyers globally," said Quintanta. The government is hoping to raise up to six time the book value of the Emetel stake through the sale. The book value of all of Emetel has been estimated at $800 million. Ecuador, with a population of 11.4 million, is one of the countries in Latina America with the lowest density of telephone lines. There are now only some 800,000 telephone lines, amounting to seven per 100 inhabitants. -- Gustavo Oviedo, Quito Newsroom, 5932 258 433
