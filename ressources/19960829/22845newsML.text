Analysts widely expect Franco-Italian agro-food giant Eridania Beghin-Say to report poor first half results due mostly to difficulties in its core starch and sugar sectors. French daily La Tribune Desfosses said to the contrary on Thursday that the group could post better than expected first half results, including a rise of over 18 percent in net profit. But many analysts were sceptical. "I think they are being very optimistic," one analyst said. An Eridania spokesman declined to comment on the newspaper report. "We do not comment on rumours," he said. Eridania is due to report first half results on September 19. It had warned in the spring that 1996 was shaping up as a difficult year due in part to climate problems, firm raw materials prices and the absence of signs of rebound in consumption. "Operational profit for the first half and for the whole year 1996 should not be good," one analyst predicted. Analysts said they were expecting operational profit to drop in the first half and possibly in full year 1996 as higher wheat and maize prices squeezed margins in the starch division while higher oil prices in Spain curbed consumption. In the United States newly acquired American maize unit was also facing an overall rise in isuglucose capacity, which is increasing competition among producers. In addition the sugar division was hurt by a poor campaign in Italy as a result of floodings. First half sales rose 5.3 percent to 25.902 billion francs but analysts cautioned that on a like-for-like basis the rise was limited to 0.8 percent. They said the first half sales figures showed a lower contribution from the sugar division and a limited rise in that of the starch sector. One analyst predicted operating profit may fall by 12-15 percent in the first half and by four percent in full year 1996. Operating profit jumped nine percent to 2.042 billion francs in the first half of 1995. The analyst said the forecast for full year 1996 took into account an expected improvement in margins in the second half of the year if the current decline in raw materials holds. Assuming the group continues to benefit from a lower tax rate this year and possible capital gains from asset sales, the analyst predicted a published 1996 net profit close to the 1.526 billion francs reported in 1995. But she predicted a slight drop in profit before exceptional items in full year 1996. Net attributable profit rose 26.3 percent in 1995 due mainly to a lower tax rate. First half 1995 net attributable profit jumped 32.4 percent to 825 million francs. --  Paris newsroom +331 4221 4332
