Italy's gross domestic product in the second quarter is set to show a small decline compared to the first quarter, but national output is not likely to start on a long-term decline, analysts said. Official statistics body ISTAT will publish second-quarter figures at 0700 GMT on Friday. "Italy will avoid a recession, whether in (a) technical sense (two successive quarters of negative growth) or in a more general sense," said Paolo Casadio at Credito Italiano. He forecast second-quarter GDP to fall 0.4 percent compared to the previous quarter and a rise of 1.1 percent on an annual basis. But for the third quarter, already in progress, he saw annual GDP up 0.2 percent on an annual basis and a 1.2-percent rise over the second April-July quarter. First-quarter 1996 GDP rose 1.5 percent on an annual basis and a 0.5-percent rise over the previous quarter. Rosa Soler at Deutsche Bank forecast a fall of 0.4 percent in the second quarter from the previous quarter and up 1.1 percent on an annual basis. Soler noted there were fewer working days in the second quarter than the first quarter. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129450
