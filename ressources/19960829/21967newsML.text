German equities ended trade lower on Thursday, after stronger-than-expected U.S. GDP figures prompted fears on the German market that the U.S. Federal Reserve was planning to raise interest rates. U.S. GDP grew by 4.8 percent in the second quarter, while analysts had expected growth of 4.2 percent. The IBIS DAX, which measures all-day electronic trade in 30 blue-chip German stocks closed at 2,548.84 points, down 7.80 points or 0.31 percent. Earlier, the 30-share DAX index, which tracks floor trade, ended the bourse session down 3.10 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,560.06. Industrial conglomerate Daimler Benz AG's first-half earnings news conference at midday was the main focus of the day. A rush of interest in the run-up to the results sent Daimler stock as high as 81.80 marks, but the shares weakened after the earnings data were released and ended the bourse session down two pfennigs at 81.30. Daimler shares were down 41 pfennigs at 80.85 marks at the end of IBIS trade. The company, which had the biggest annual loss ever for a German company in 1995, reported six-month operating profit of 827 million marks -- at the top end of expectations. Dealers said there was no logical reason for the drop. "Buy the rumour, sell the fact," commented one Frankfurt trader. Other car shares also fell. Volkswagen, earlier boosted by a report of a 58 percent first-half profit rise at its Audi unit, ended the session down two marks at 549.50 marks. However, Volkswagen recovered in electronic trade to close at 550 marks, up 90 pfennigs. Chemical shares were also notably under pressure, which dealers attributed to profit-taking after the sector's recent popularity. Hoechst ended the day 1.61 percent down at 51.85 marks. Shares in electronics and engineering giant Siemens AG ended 66 pfennigs down at 78.18 on reports that Iran was suing the company for 5.4 billion dollars for failing to complete a nuclear power plant abandoned after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
