Shares in German industrial conglomerate Daimler-Benz AG traded off their highs on Thursday after the group reported first-half operating profit of 827 million marks, on the top end of expectations. Daimler stock was up 18 pfennigs at 81.50 marks at 1008 GMT, off its session high of 81.80 marks. "Buy the rumour, sell the fact," commented one Frankfurt trader, who said the Daimler results were generally good. "These are certainly at the top end of expectations. There is no logical reason for the shares to drop," said another dealer. --Catherine O'Mahony, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
