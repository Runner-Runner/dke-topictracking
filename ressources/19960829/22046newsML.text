Pakistan now expects its wheat crop to reach only 17 million tonnes in 1996/97 (July-June), compared to a targeted 17.57 million tonnes, Food and Agriculture Minister Nawab Yousaf Talpur said on Thursday.   "I foresee that it will be difficult to achieve the target and the crop will be around 17 million tonnes," he told Reuters, without giving a reason for the shortfall. Talpur said Pakistan had hoped to hold its wheat imports to 1.8 million tonnes, but the crop shortfall meant there would probably have to be a corresponding increase in imports. Pakistan imported 1.9 million tonnes of wheat from the United States and Australia in 1995/96. -- Tahir Ikram 9251-274757
