Australian Finance Minister John Fahey said on Friday the country could achieve the GDP growth rates projected by the government if it could use tighter fiscal policy to take pressure off monetary policy. "I believe, if we can continue to bear down on interest rates through the contribution government is making to increasing national savings, that we should approach the future with some confident that there will be that growth," Fahey told reporters.   The government's budget projections depend on GDP-growth forecasts of 3.5 percent in 1996/97, 3.25 percent in 1997/98 and 3.5 percent in 1998/99 and 1999/00 -- all in year-average terms. The August 20 budget detailed savings of A$3.9 billion in 1996/97 rising to A$7.2 billion the following year. The government says that by reducing its borrowing it will increase Australia's net national savings, the shortage of which is blamed for the current account deficit, high long-term interest rates and inadequate investment. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
