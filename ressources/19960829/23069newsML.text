The SouthFert Co-op board recommended shareholders accept the Bay of Plenty Co-op takeover offer now that the Commerce Commission had given the official all-clear, said SouthFert chairman Peter Macdougall on Thursday. The commission approved the company's bid to acquire 100 percent of the shares of the fertiliser co-op, based near Invercargill, on Wednesday. "I urge shareholders to carefully consider Bay of Plenty Co-op's offer when it arrives and accept. Even if shareholders have already accepted a prior offer from Ravensdown, they can still accept Bay of Plenty Co-op's offer," Macdougall said.   Ravensdown, which had for months been competing with Bay of Plenty Co-op for control of SouthFert, its South Island competitor, had since appealed and would argue the commission's decision in the High Court in October. If Ravensdown was successful in overturning the commission's ruling, the Bay of Plenty Co-op offer would lapse. Bay of Plenty Co-op would be mailing shareholders a formal offer document at the end of this week. --Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746
