Weakness in U.S. Treasuries spilled over to emerging market debts, dragging all Latin debts lower. Mexico Bradies were also affected by the new turbulence in the southern part of the country, traders said. Trading was light before the long Labor Day weekend. "The market isn't going anywhere," said a Brady trader. "Prices just drifted lower with the Treasuries." Overall Brady bonds held better than U.S. bonds for most of the day, until they were marked lower when the T-bond showed no signs of trimming losses, he said.
