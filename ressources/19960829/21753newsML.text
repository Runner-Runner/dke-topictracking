U.S. rail freight containers in the week ended August 24 were at a record weekly total, the Association of American Railroads said Thursday. AAR reported 93,665 containers in the week, up 6.4 percent from 88,051 containers in the year-ago week. Also in the intermodal sector, trailers increased 7.2 percent to 72,276 from 67,413 last year. Total intermodal volume was up 6.7 percent from last year. There were 358,154 carloads in the week, up 0.4 percent from 356,805 in the year-ago week, AAR said.   AAR reported 26.7 billion ton-miles in the week, up 1.5 percent from 26.3 billion in the year-ago week. A ton-mile equals one ton of freight hauled one mile. "With the exception of grain loadings, rail traffic is reflective of a fairly strong economy," AAR chief economist Harvey Levine said. "Intermodal, automotive, chemicals, lumber and coal all have been showing healthy increases in recent weeks," Levine added. Lumber and wood product carloadings totalled 5,797, up 5.9 percent from 5,474 a year ago, while motor vehicles and parts totalled 21,151, up 10.3 percent from 19,170 carloads last year. Chemical loadings stood at 32,177, up 4.3 percent from 30,837 last year, while coal carloads totalled 141,383, up 5.9 percent from 133,471 in the year-ago week. But grain carloadings, at 19,925 in the week, fell 29.1 percent from 28,092 last year. In the first 34 weeks of 1996, AAR said ton-miles rose 2.5 percent from the same period last year. Total intermodal traffic was up 0.3 percent, but carloadings fell 0.7 percent in the period, it said.
