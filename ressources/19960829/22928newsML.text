The board of Credit Foncier, the troubled lender due to be taken over by state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) as part of a government plan to wind it down, will publish first half results on Thursday or Friday morning, a Foncier spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman declined to comment on a report in L'Agefi financial daily that the property lender would announce a first half profit of 200 to 400 million francs ($39.5-$79.1 million) rather than an expected loss of 520 million francs. She said the board was meeting at 1530 GMT on Thursday and results would be released Thursday evening or Friday morning. L'Agefi said that a profit could have repercussions for the CDC offer, which is being made on behalf of the government at a price of 70 francs a share. In July, Finance Minister Jean Arthuis announced plans for a takeover to be carried out by the CDC before a "managed wind-down" of Credit Foncier, which ran up huge property loan and investment losses as the bottom fell out of the property market in the early 1990s. Credit Foncier reported losses of 10.8 billion francs for 1995 after provisions for property losses of 13.6 billion francs. The accounts were contested by one shareholder action group, Adam, which said the provisions had been overdone and demanded at least 100 francs a share in any state-orchestrated buyout. The group is private but has top management controlled by the government due to its status as a "specialised financial institution". The government has commissioned an independent study on the price of 70 francs a share which it says is equitable. The takeover, which will cost in the region of 2.5 billion francs, has yet to be executed and requires acceptances covering two-thirds of the shares in the group. ($ = 5.057 French Francs)
