Advantage Group Ltd said on Friday one-off restructuring charges, investment in its Relationship Management Systems Division and a major upgrade of internal information systems had reduced its 1995/96 profitability. Earlier the company reported a 22 percent fall in June year profit to $2.37 million. Australia had become a major income source for the group with Australian revenues growing by 58 percent. "We expect to see even greater contributions from our Australian operation this year," Advantage said.   Major initiatives were undertaken in hardware and software product developments which produced good results. Margins tightened somewhat in New Zealand while sales increased significantly in Australia. EFTPOS terminal market share had reduced marginally in New Zealand to 75 percent but sales volume continue to increase. The development of electronic purse programmes and loyalty programmes was providing new momentum for sales of terminals, Advantage said. In addition, Advantage was continuing to invest in products and services with strong focus on the post transaction area.   This is the area where there is most potential for future revenue growth, it said. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
