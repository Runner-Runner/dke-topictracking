Chrysler Corp. said Thursday it has set a new model-year U.S. sales record with more than a month remaining befor the 1997 model year gets underway. Chrysler said its U.S. dealers sold 2,189,420 new Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, Jeep and Eagle vehicles from Oct. 1, 1995, through Aug. 28, 1996. The previous record for a full model year -- Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 -- was 2,186,128 units in 1994. Chrysler's sales for the model year to date are running 11 percent ahead of sales in the same period a year ago. Its share of the U.S. market for the model year to date is 15.8 percent, 1.7 percentage points higher than last year. Chrysler's sales in the 1995 model year were reduced significantly by the slow launch of its redesigned minivans. This year, the automaker is producing minivans and full-size Dodge Ram pickup trucks at record levels.
