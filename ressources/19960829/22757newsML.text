Prime Minister Alain Juppe, struggling with record unemployment and facing threats of labour unrest, urged France's ambassadors on Thursday to project optimism and confidence about France abroad. He said they should "give the image of a country which wants to modernise and reform and which has the ability to do it". "It must be done because it's the truth. France is a dear and old nation but one that knows how to adapt and a country preparing its future," the conservative prime minister told French ambassadors from around the world at a lunch. A year ago, the envoys' main task was to try to blunt foreign outrage about France's nuclear tests in the South Pacific. This year, they will be trying to make the best of a spluttering economy, record unemployment and threats of labour unrest that are raising doubts about France's ability to qualify for a single European currency from 1999. Juppe told ambassadors to mobilise to "give France the image of a country that is strong, politically stable, economically rich and socially balanced." "Like everywhere, there is of course resistance to change, conservative habits, fears of the future. But there is also dynamism, imagination and determination," he said, pointing to reforms under way ranging from welfare to defence.
