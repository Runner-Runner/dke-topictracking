Roger Moore, the British actor and children's rights activist, said on Thursday a paedophile had made sexual overtures towards him when he was on boys' camping trip at the age of eight. Speaking in his capacity as UNICEF's special representative for the film arts, Moore told reporters at a conference on child sex abuse that the incident had influenced his decision to work in children's rights. "The whole story was that my friend and I, we were in the Cubs (junior Boy Scouts), we had a tent. We went on to Wimbledon Common (in London) we put our tent up and a man came," said Moore, famous for playing tough secret agent James Bond. "He sort of said I had nice knees which I thought was a bit peculiar," Moore, now 68, told a crowd of journalists. He said the man continued with his advances but that the incident was relatively minor and he managed to escape before the man could make any more serious move. "I left the tent and I was sitting on a branch and after a couple of minutes he came up and he made another suggestive remark about my anatomy...he made a grab and I just rolled backwards over the branch and ran off." Moore said the incident illustrated many children's inability to talk to adults about issues that troubled them and it was a catalyst for his work promoting children's rights. "I was 16 before I told my mother because somewhere deep down I had a sense of guilt that maybe I had done something wrong," Moore said. "Sometimes (children) can't be heard because their voices are not strong enough and there's nobody to hear them. And so we as UNICEF representatives are the voices of those silent children." Over 1,000 delegates from 130 countries gathered in Stockholm this week for the first World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, to discuss the scope of abuse of children, legal reform and raising public awareness.
