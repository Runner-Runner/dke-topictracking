Credit du Nord, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Groupe Paribas, said on Thursday it wants to get directly involved in life insurance products through its joint venture company, Antarius, set up with Cardif. Cardif is the life products unit of Cie Bancaire, which is also part of the Paribas group. Credit du Nord has sold Cardif products since 1977 through its bank branches. "Life insurance is absolutely strategic to Credit du Nord," said Philippe Toussaint, chairman of Antarius and Credit du Nord. Life sales through the Credit du Nord network represented 26 percent of 1995 turnover for Cardif. The launch of Antarius was announced in March and it began selling life and savings products at the end of July. At the time, the details of strategy were not spelled out. Credit du Nord saw new premiums rise 17 percent last year to 3.4 billion francs and stood at 2.3 billion at the end of July. Some 17 percent of its banking clients hold life products and it wants to increase this in the coming years through Antarius and its own sales force. It gave no sales target. Cardif manages more than 17 billion francs in life policy assets for Credit du Nord clients. Life policies are a highly popular savings product for French households due to tax benefits. The government is expected to reduce some of the tax advantages of life contracts in its forthcoming fiscal reform.
