Greek equities resumed their climb after a flat open closing with mild gains in heavy volume. Construction stocks stole the show with strong gains of 4.14 percent in active trade with analysts remaining bullish. "A slow advance is better than the fast runup which recently unfolded and took the bourse to 950 from 870 points. Early polls were the spark for the oversold market to climb back to more reasonable valuations," said Xiosbank portfolio strategist Stathis Nazos. "The correction will be mostly a rotation to other stocks and sectors, from banking to construction for example, as was the case today. But the benchmark index will not slip below 940 points and the interim resistance at 950 will be overcome," he said. The Athens general share index closed 0.31 percent, or 2.89 points higher at 948.55 from Wednesday's 945.66 close after opening at 945.61 points. Turnover rose to 11.07 billion drachmas on volume of 5.3 million shares. Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos has signed a decree ordering the dissolution of the 300-seat parliament ahead of early elections on September 22. Market watchers said stocks would consolidate around 940 points as players would now opt for undervalued issues that did not participate in the advance. Other brokers said sentiment remained bullish on expectations that snap polls will bring about a strong government that will steer the economy harder towards its EMU goal. Gainers led losers 102 to 92 with 41 issues unchanged on 235 traded. Banks slipped 0.39 percent, industrials ended 0.27 percent firmer with construction jumping 4.14 percent. Small-caps closed flat. The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted at 568-586 at the close. Shares of OTE telecom  OTEr.AT, the underlying, ended unchanged at 4,040 drachmas in active trade. The recently launched Merrill Lynch stock index call warrant based on a basket of 23 shares was quoted lower at 223.30-235.10 drachmas. It expires on January 9 1998 with a strike price of 1000. It was in the money at 1047.4. The Morgan Stanley Hellenic Blue Chip Warrant, which has a strike price of 100 marks, was quoted at 3,844-4,094 drachmas at the close. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
