Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Thursday defended France's battle against inflation after criticism from an ex-member of his government. "We have in the past few years eradicated inflation," Juppe said in a speech to French ambassadors at the foreign ministry. "I couldn't have been more stunned to see that in the end, some are sorry. As though all over the world people are not trying to eradicate inflation because less inflation means more purchasing power and more justice," Juppe said. He was responding to an article by former finance minister Alain Madelin in French daily Le Monde in which Madelin, a fervent supporter of free market economics, said France was in a period of deflation. Madelin, sacked last August after a clash with Juppe over the speed of economic reform in France, said the government's policies were likely to aggravate the deflation which could lead to social disorder and political instability. In the speech, Juppe also reaffirmed France's commitment to European monetary union. He said France will be "meet the deadline for economic and monetary union within the criteria and the timetable." -- Paris Newsroom +331 4221 5452
