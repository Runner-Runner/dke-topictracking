German private bank Schroeder Muenchmeyer Hengst announced the launch of a new investment fund on Thursday, aimed at wooing risk-averse German investors away from bonds into equity-based funds. The new fund, the SMH-System 99, has a safety-net designed to limit investment losses in a calendar year to two percent, which SMH's Hans-Joerg Frantzmann likened to an insurance policy at a news conference to launch the new product. Worst-case scenarios could include situations where the DAX index falls more than 15 percent overnight or where interest rates on mark time deposits fall below two percent. The fund will invest in shares on the German DAX index of 30 blue-chip stocks and DAX receipts of participation. Risk will be hedged using a combination of DAX options and futures. The SMH-System 99 fund will run until the end of 1999.
