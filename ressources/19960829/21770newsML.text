MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed, and traders said the continued lack of hedge pressure was supportive in an otherwise bearish session. "We've got a situation where the people who have gone short in the cash market can't originate as much grain as they hoped because the farmers aren't selling," one trader said. "So instead of covering their cash shorts, they're buying Sept, selling Dec, in the theory that they'll invert the spread and cause grain to move," the trader said. Traders said farmers were not selling because they were bullish wheat and could afford to wait to sell. MGE spring wheat was pressured throughout the session by feelings that it might be overvalued relative to CBOT wheat in light of the improving world wheat production outlook. MGE spring wheat closed 4-3/4 cents per bushel lower to two cents higher, with Sept up two cents at $4.66. Dec shed 2-3/4 cents to close at $4.55-1/4. The MGE estimated Thursday's spring wheat volume at 30.131 million bushels, versus 23.772 million Wednesday. MGE barley closed steady to two cents per hundredweight lower, with Sept unchanged at $7.60. --Greg Frost, 816 561-8671
