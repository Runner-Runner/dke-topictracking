AmeriJet International Inc, the Fort Lauderdale all-cargo airline, business is such on its new service to Venezuela that it may add a fifth weekly flight, a company official said Wednesday. "The volumes are good and have been increasing. We are thinking of adding another weekly flight," AmeriJet vice president Pam Rollins told Reuters in a telephone interview. AmeriJet also is planning a scheduled service to the Dominican Republic. "We are waiting for our license (from the Dominican Republic) and hope to begin scheduled service within the next 30 days," said Rollins. AmeriJet had been serving the Dominican Republic on an ad hoc charter basis. Southbound to Venezuela, Amerijet is carrying a variety of cargo including computers, high-tech equipment, electronics and machinery for Venezuela's oil industry, according to Rollins. Northbound it brings mostly fish and seafood and some so-called "807 garments" -- those that have been cut in the United States and are assembled elsewhere. Amerijet, which has 12 Boeing 727s, is flying to Caracas, Valencia and Maracaibo. It provides a weekly service to Margarita via Aeropuerto Internacional de Porlamar. The privately-held airline began flying to Venezuela in June. Israel Carruyo, owner and managing director of Servicios Iscar C.A., has been appointed Amerijet's general sales agent in Venezuela. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44-171-542-7706 Fax+44-171-542-8982
