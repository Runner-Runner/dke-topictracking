Industry analysts on average expect Swissair AG to report a group net loss of 51 million Swiss francs on Friday, down up from a net loss of 86 million in the first half of 1995. Swissair's results are notoriously difficult for analysts to forecast and estimates from analysts in London and Zurich range from a net loss of 70 million to a loss of 30 million. "First-half forecasts for Swissair are basically a lottery," said one analyst, noting profit margins are so slim in the airline business that a slight change in revenue can have a very large effect on the bottom line. Swissair's operating profit is forecast to improve to 34.3 million francs compared with 17 million, reflecting that business is not quite as dismal as the bottom line may suggest. Group revenue is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 3.4 billion francs from 3.26 billion last year. Swissair's results are expected to be released around 1000 GMT and analysts will be briefed by management in the afternoon. The main factors affecting Swissair's financial performance is the continuing yield erosion, which drags its core flight operations into the red, while its non-airline operations, especially catering, continue to perform very profitably. The airline business is also very seasonal and Swissair will be affected by the same forces in the first half that have hit its other European competitors, such as Deutsche Lufthansa AG and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
