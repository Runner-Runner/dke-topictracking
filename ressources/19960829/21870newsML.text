Virginia Power Co's 911 megawatt North Anna nuclear unit 1 resumed limited output early Thursday after tripping off line Wednesday, a company spokesman said. The unit is currently operating at 30 percent of capacity and will hold at that level for an undetermined period for restart testing, spokesman William Byrd said Thursday. "It can (hold at 30 percent) for as long as 10 to 12 hours, or perhaps even longer," Byrd said. The unit, located at Mineral, Va. will ramp up to full power following the 30 percent test hold, the spokesman said. -- New York Power Desk 212-859-1627
