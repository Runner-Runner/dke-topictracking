Bonos stayed higher late Thursday, helped by the gradual return of Spanish investors to the market after the holiday season, dealers said. Those investors have been animated by the prospect of what appear to be signs of a tighter 1997 budget than originally anticipated, and this was underpinning prices, one analyst said. Meanwhile, the peseta clawed back some of its losses versus the mark, in line with the French franc and the dollar's gains against the German currency. However, peseta trading was dull and with little market-moving data due, more of the same is expected on Friday.    -- Madrid newsroom +341 585 2160
