Shares in public transport group Stagecoach Holdings Plc bounced on Thursday after directors took up their allocation of the company's rights issue, dealers said. By 1355 GMT, the shares were up 15p to 523-1/2p. "The share price move is down to the mechanics of the rights issue," said Richard Hannah, transport analyst at UBS. UBS placed some nil paid shares in the company after the two main directors of Stagecoach sold them in order to take up their full allocation of the new shares.   "It always helps sentiment when a director wants to take up his rights," said one dealer. "It was a hefty placing yesterday and has provided a platform for the shares, which are pretty volatile anyway," he added. -- Elaine Hardcastle, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4027
