China refrigerator maker Guangdong Kelon, which reported an interim net of 245.68 million yuan, up 29.4 percent, said on Thursday that it was confident healthy profits would be sustained in the second half of 1996. "With steady production, stable raw material costs, our profit margins would be sustained in the second half," said Don Lee, vice-president of finance at a news conference. The newly-listed company, China's largest fridge maker, had a turnover of 1.499 billion yuan between January and June 1996, up 39.5 percent compared to the same period in 1995. It would produce 1.5 million refrigerators in 1996. Dismissing critics' claims that the company would suffer under competition from other Chinese producers as well as imports, Lee said the company had already expanded into Japan and would be introducing nine new products. The company also intended to spend 1.8 percent of total expenditure in 1996 on advertising to raise company profile. It is also pursuing other opportunities to establish a satellite factory, after a joint venture agreement with Huanghe Machinery & Electrical Co Ltd fell through earlier. The deal was cancelled last week after Huanghe's parent company formalised a merger with another refrigerator maker, Changling Electrical Appliances Co, which violated the non-competition clause in the joint venture agreement. Kelon, however, said the cancellation would have no material impact on earnings for 1996, as the company did not make any sizeable investment on the plan. --Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 28436441
