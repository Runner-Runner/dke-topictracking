The Israeli shekel rose slightly against the dollar and basket of foreign currencies in mixed trading, dealers said. "The Bank of Israel was not seen in the market today and activity was low and mixed. When the session opened the shekel rose mildly," said a dealer at United Mizrahi Bank. On Tuesday and Wednesday the Bank intervened, buying foreign currency just before the closing of the trading day and after the representative rate was published. The shekel can fluctuate in a trading band of 7.0 percent above or below a slope designed to devalue the Israeli currency at six percent a year against the basket of key currencies. If the shekel-basket exchange rate reaches the lower trading band the central bank intervenes by buying foreign currency. "The central bank has been coming in only at the end of the day and it has been buying only small amounts of foreign currency," the dealer said. The representative rate for the dollar was 3.1390 versus 3.1410 on Wednesday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, closed at 3.5384 shekels versus 3.5392 on Wednesday. On the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.8992 shekels per 100 yen versus 2.8989 on Wednesday and against the mark at 2.1256 shekels per mark versus 2.1243 on Wednesday. In late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.1390 shekels. - Dan Gerstenfeld, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
