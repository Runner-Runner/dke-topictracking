The state-run Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) said on Thursday it would resume operation of a nuclear power plant on Saturday. KEPCO closed down the 950-megawatt plant in Yongwang in southwestern South Korea earlier this month after detecting radiation leakage. "We have conducted maintenance work and fixed several tubes of a steam generator that leaked coolant containing radioactive material," a KEPCO spokesman said. He said the leakage was only one tenth of the radiation levels permitted by international standards and the radiation was contained within the plant. The company also plans a maintenance closure of another 950-megawatt unit as a precautionary measure between September 3 and October 24, he said. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5643
