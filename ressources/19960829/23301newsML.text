Tosoh Akzo Co, a Tosoh Corp affiliate, has started supplying alkyl aluminium to Nippon Aluminum Alkyls Ltd, whose Osaka plant has been closed since an explosion in July, a Tosoh spokesman said on Thursday. Tosoh Akzo and Nippon Aluminum Alkyls are the only firms in Japan that produce alkyl aluminium, which is used as a catalyst to manufacture polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Nippon Aluminum Alkyls said it is not yet known when the firm can bring the plant back on line as the cause of the accident is still being investigated. The company's 3,000 tonne per year plant in Osaka, western Japan, was rocked by an explosion on July 17 that injured 11 factory workers. Before the accident, Tosoh Akzo had about a 60 percent share in Japan's alkyl aluminium market, with the remainder held by Nippon Aluminum Alkyls, an affiliate of Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc.
