The Federal Reserve had no large one-day net misses in its reserve projections in the latest week, a Fed spokesman said. As for the pattern of borrowing, about 25 percent of the adjustment borrowing in the week was done by the small banks, while about 75 percent was done by the large regionals. There was no borrowing by the money center banks. On Wednesday, all of the adjustment borrowing was done by the small banks. The high in natural float was about $1.0 billion on Tuesday, while the low was about $125 million on Monday. Transportation float averaged $100 million per day with the high on Tuesday at about $200 million due to fog in the Charleston, W.V. area and aircraft delays in Miami. -- Donna Sells, 212-859-1668
