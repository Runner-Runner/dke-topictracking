Israel and the PLO will hold talks on Thursday, hours after the end of a Palestinian strike called as a protest against Israeli policy on settlements and Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said. Former Israeli army chief Dan Shomron and Palestinian Local Government Minister Saeb Erekat will meet at a Jerusalem hotel at 1130 GMT. They are chairmen of the Israel-Palestinian steering committee that oversees implementation of the self-rule accord, the spokesman said in a statement.   Erekat confirmed he would meet Shomron. "We have been requesting a meeting of the Steering Committee...we hope (it) will result in the immediate reciprocal implementation of the agreements signed," Erekat told reporters. Palestinians have been demanding that Israel carry out its long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron, a partial pullout pledged by the former Labour government. Israel's new right-wing government is still studying a revised redeployment plan formulated by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai that is likely to leave more soldiers in Hebron to protect some 450 Jewish settlers living among more than 100,000 Palestinians.
