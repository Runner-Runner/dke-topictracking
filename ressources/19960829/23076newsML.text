Wine, appliance and packaging group Southcorp Holdings Ltd is expected on Monday to announce a lower net profit before abnormals than in 1994/95's A$115.3 million, an outcome well flagged by the company. Southcorp warned investors in May to expect results slightly below last year's net profit due to a combination of price pressures on the company's U.S. water heater operation and difficult trading conditions in Australia. The median forecast in BZW's BARCEP broker survey is for a A$107.5 million net profit before abnormals, with 14 analysts forecasting a profit range of A$99 million to A$112 million.   Analyst George Clapham from BT Securities told Reuters he was forecasting a A$107.0 million result, reflecting a good performance for the company's wine division, poor results from appliances, and a squeeze on the packaging operations. Clapham said a key feature of the results would be contributions from acqusitions, particularly Smorgons, where he saw investment return well below its cost of capital. He said the real concern was with the U.S. water heater business, which the company had hoped would post a profit in the June quarter, but which he did not expect to turn around in the first half of 1996/97.   Southcorp's domestic appliance business also could face worsening news, with stronger offshore competition through a firmer Australian dollar and reduced tariffs from July 1996, a squeeze yet to come on housing completions and continued depressed consumer confidence, he said. However, he said he was positive on Southcorp Wines, expecting "another cracker of a year" for the division in 1996/97, and on the company's new management structure. Another analyst, who did not want to be named, forecast earnings at A$112.0 million before abnormals.   "It could be a bit lower, it could be a bit higher, but it won't come as a big surprise either way," he said. "(The outlook for the first half of 1996/97) will not be dramatically different, and a lot will turn on exactly how they go in the U.S. appliance division," he said. He said he anticipated another interim loss, although modest, from the U.S. Greg Dring, from Macquarie Equities, forecast a 1995/96 pre-abnormals result of A$109.0 million, but saw improvement in the first half of 1996/97 and forecast an eight percent rise in interim net profit compared to the first half of 1995/96.   While steady volumes were expected in the first half of 1996/97 for domestic appliances compared to the second half of 1995/96, Southcorp would have a better product mix, therefore better pricing and gross margins, he said. The U.S. water heater business was "trickier", but he saw improvement for the six months to December 31 1996 on higher volumes, a slightly improved pricing environment, and lower costs, he said. "That all adds up to a slightly better result," he said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800
