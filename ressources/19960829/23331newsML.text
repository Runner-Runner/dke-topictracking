The Philippine Central Bank said on Thursday it had withdrawn its termed reverse repos and offered instead short-term special series Treasury bills.   The bank withdrew its one-month, two-month and three-month reverse repos and instead offered 76-day T-bills and 83-day T-bills at 11.6 percent, and 90-day T-bills at 11.65 percent. The Central Bank, however, left the overnight borrowing rate unchanged at 10.5 percent and the lending rate at 13.0 percent. Central Bank officials were not immediately available for comment. But a government securities trader said the withdrawal showed that the Central Bank was allowing short-term rates to go down further. He added the 90-day special series T-bill rate, which was pegged at 11.65 percent, was significantly lower than the 12.0290 percent average rate at this week's primary auction. "We will not have any benchmark any more. We won't have any other alternative but to go to T-bills," he said. August inflation figures due next week are expected to show a continuing decline. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
