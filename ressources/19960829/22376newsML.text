They expected the second quarter price index at up 2.1 percent increase, and the implicit price deflator to rise 1.9 percent. The 4.8 percent increase in the revised estimate of the second quarter gross domestic product was the largest gain since a 4.9 percent rise in the second quarter of 1994, the department said.
