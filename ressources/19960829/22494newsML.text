Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos raised by 10 cents a barrel the price of its Maya and Olmeca crudes for September but kept Isthmus unchanged for U.S. clients, a Pemex official said on Thursday. The company kept prices to European lifters unchanged for both Maya and its high quality Isthmus grades and lowered by 25 cents the price its Far Eastern contract holders would pay for Maya. As a result of the change, Maya loaded in September for the United States will be priced at a discount of $1.10 a barrel to the Pemex formula compared to -$1.20 in August. Isthmus was unchanged at -70 cents and Olmeca rose to +40 cents from +30 cents the previous month. For Europe, prices were held at -85 cents for Maya and Isthmus at +29 cents. Far Eastern lifters will pay -$2.70 for Maya in September instead of -$2.45. Isthmus was unchanged at +55 cents. -- Kate Dourian, London newsroom +44 171 542 7629
