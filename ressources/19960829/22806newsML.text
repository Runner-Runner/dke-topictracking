French tobacco company Seita has started legal proceedings against Salomon Brothers in the New York Supreme Court over losses of $29.8 million on swaps transactions in 1994, lawyers for Seita said on Thursday. The lawyers said their case was based on charges that the bank did not respect its duties of informing and advising its client, the presentation of inexact or incomplete data on the financial derivatives products concerned, as well as negligence and breach of contract. One of the lawyers told Reuters a case had previously been filed against Salomon in the same affair but dismissed by a federal court, although on purely jurisdictional grounds. "It was not dismissed on the substance, only on jurisdiction," the lawyer said. Seita itself had no comment but was expected to issue a statement after 1500 GMT, the lawyer said. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
