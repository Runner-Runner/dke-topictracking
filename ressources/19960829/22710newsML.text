Norwegian shares moved sideways on Thursday with dealers saying there were few impulses to trade on. "Many investors expect a quiet, flat market ahead, so I guess the future will depend on how the big blue chips perform," said one dealer. The Total index closed 1.2 points up at 826.7 points, an increase of 0.15 percent, in turnover of 720 million crowns. Industrial giant Norsk Hydro climbed 2.5 crowns to 300 crowns in trade worth 138 million crowns.   "There has been a lot of buying interest in Norsk Hydro, especially from abroad," said one dealer. "The oil price has climbed above 20 dollars, and oil-related companies overseas have performed well too lately." Norwegian seismic exploration company Petroleum Geo-Services plunged 8.50 crowns after it announced it would propose a public offering of 4.6 million American Depository Shares (ADS). The company said it intended to file a registration statement relating to the securities to be offered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the near future. --Oslo newsroom +47 22 42 50 41
