South Koreas largest ticket outlets have refused to sell tickets for Michael Jacksons HIStory concert, the Korea Herald newspaper reported on Thursday. Major banks and bookstores, among popular spots to buy tickets in South Korea, said they would not sell the tickets. Their refusal to unload tickets follows pressure from a coalition of Christian and civic organisations who oppose Jacksons appearance because of 1993 child molestation allegations against the singer. Jackson was cleared of all charges. The coalition has also said the expense of bringing Jackson to South Korea was a waste of money, the paper reported. Jackson is scheduled to appear in the country on October 11-13. Concert organiser, Taewon Arts, has also run into trouble finding a security company willing to oversee safety during the concerts. The only local company considered capable of providing security at the huge event has refused the job, the paper said. In 1994, the Cultural Ministry rejected a proposal to bring Jackson to South Korea on grounds that the performance would have a negative influence on youth morals.
