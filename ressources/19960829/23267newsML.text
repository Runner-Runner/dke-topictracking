Taiwan share prices closed higher on Thursday on active late buying of blue chips favoured by foreign funds, brokers said. The index ended up 55.67 points or 0.89 percent at an intraday high of 6,312.43. Turnover was a modest T$38 billion. Dealers saw active late buying on blue chips, or so-called foreign fund-concept shares. Financials led the gains, with Cathay Life up T$3 to T$169. "As Morgan Stanley will to include Taiwan in its global indices from September 2, any buying on blue chips would easily trigger more buying," said Ben Lee of Nomura Securities.   Plastics, chemicals, steels and constructions also were strong. China Steel added 50 cents to T$27. Cathay Construction gained T$1.7 to T$48.7. Formosa Chemical Fibre rose T$1.1 to T$33.7. Computer giant Acer fell 40 cents to T$35.2 after its board slashed its 1996 profit target by half to T$3 billion, though brokers said further selling was unlikely. "Acer should have neared its bottom level in share price as its profit performance should improve entering a hot-sale season in the third and fourth quarters," said Albert Lin of Golden Securities.   Active late buying helped the index break initial resistance at 6,300, and brokers said upward momentum likely would continue to test the next technical resistance at 6,330. "I believe the index is in a firming trend, rather than a surging one," Lee of Nomura said. For Friday, a 6,270-6,350 range was seen. -- James Peng (5080815)
