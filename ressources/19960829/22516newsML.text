Three holidaying Britons have been wounded in a shooting incident at their hotel in southern Turkey, the British Embassy in Ankara said on Thursday. An embassy spokesman named the three as Phillip Styles (49), Stuart Beaumont (48), and Maxime Lee Tarleton (28). They were wounded by shotgun pellets in an apparent dispute on Wednesday between the hotel owner and another individual in the resort of Kumluca in Antalya province. Styles is still receiving hospital treatment and will require an operation to remove the pellets, while Beaumont and Tarleton have both been allowed out of hospital, the spokesman said. He said the embassy was awaiting further information on the incident from the police. There were no further details.
