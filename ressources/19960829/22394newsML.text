The National Basketball Association has sued America Online Inc, alleging that the United States' No 1 on-line service is delivering real-time information about league games without its permission, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The suit was filed on Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan and is another legal skirmish over what constitutes a "broadcast" in the computer age. The suit contends America Online was misappropriating NBA property by providing a site containing continually updated scores and statistics of NBA games in progress. America Online chairman and chief executive Steve Case said, "We believe the new online medium should have the same right to report on real-time events and news as television and radio." America Online said its dispute with the NBA began three weeks ago, when the online company filed suit against the league in Virginia. The earlier lawsuit seeks to have a court declare that American Online is within its rights in using the real-time NBA scores and statistics and that the NBA may not legally bar the company from doing so. The cases are related to a suit that the NBA filed earlier this year against Sports Team Analysis and Tracking Systems Inc. The company provides data to America Online and is also a defendant in the case. -- New York newsroom, (212) 859-1610
