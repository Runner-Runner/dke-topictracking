New Zealand property development, construction and investment company Mainzeal Group said on Thursday it was likely to report a profit after tax of NZ$6.5 million in the year to June 30. It said this was a significant improvement on last year's NZ$2.8 million. The company also forecasts that it will resume paying dividends again, after a break of two years, based on a "substantial improvement" in its earnings.
