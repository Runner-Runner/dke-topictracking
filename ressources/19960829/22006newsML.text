Britain wants India to permit official international observers to monitor local polls in Kashmir next month but New Delhi has refused to admit any, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Thursday. "We would prefer to see official international observers but that is not currently on offer," Rifkind, on a two-day visit to the Indian capital, told Reuters in an interview. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the government of Jammu and Kashmir state said foreign individuals would not be barred from observing state assembly elections that start on September 7, but that teams of official observers would not be permitted. "We would certainly like to see observers present," Rifkind said, adding that Britain would keep an eye on the assembly polls, the state's first since a separatist revolt erupted in 1990, to see if they were free and fair. "The Indian government has said at the moment they are not contemplating international observers, but that any person who wishes to go to Jammu and Kashmir and see the elections can do so on their own authority," Rifkind said. "So there will be plenty of people from the international community, I suspect, present on the day." In remarks prepared for delivery in a speech later on Thursday, Rifkind said the polls could help lead mostly Hindu India's only Moslem majority state away from the violence that has killed 20,000 people since the rebellion began. But he said for the elections to succeed, they had to be free and fair. "I hope that next month those who want to vote will be allowed to do so," he added. "And I hope that those who prefer not to vote will have their wishes respected too. Terrorism must not be allowed to trample on democracy." Human rights organisations said that during parliamentary elections in the state in May, security forces coerced people in some areas to vote, a charge Indian authorities deny.
