Audi AG, the luxury carmaker unit of Volkswagen AG, said on Thursday that it would begin operations at a new German paint factory by 1999. Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel said in an interview that investment in the plant, scheduled to be built in Audi's corporate headquarter town of Ingolstadt, would total about 300 million to 500 million marks. Construction was expected to start in 1996. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
