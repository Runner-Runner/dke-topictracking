An airliner carrying Russian coal miners to the remote Arctic island of Spitzbergen crashed on Thursday, killing all 141 passengers and crew, Norwegian officials and the Russian airline said. Spitzbergen is a Norwegian coal-mining settlement. The only other community is in the Russian village of Barentsburg. Russia and Norway share the island's resources under a treaty dating back to the 1920s. The crash took place in bad weather 10 km (six miles) east of Longyearbyen, the island's only airstrip. "No survivors have been found and our first aid staff are returning from the crash site," local government official Kjetil Hansen told reporters. The Norwegian news agency NTB quoted a Vnukovo Airlines official as saying no one appeared to have survived The Tupolev 154, chartered by the Russian mining company Trust Arktik Ugol, left Moscow with 129 passengers and a crew of 12. It carried miners, who were travelling to work in one of the island's two open cast coal mines, and their familes, Russian officials told the Norwegian news agency. Air traffic officials said they had lost contact with the flight, scheduled to arrive at around 10.15 a.m. (0815 GMT), shortly before it was due to land. First rescuers arrived shortly after 1 p.m. and reported that most of the three-engine jet's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small Opera mountain while the rest had slid down the mountainside.
