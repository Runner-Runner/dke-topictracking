A weak technical picture brought on by bearish fundamental sentiment pushed CME pork belly futures into sell stops and prices ended down as much as the 2.000 cent per lb limit. Hog futures also finished weaker on fundamental and fund pressure, traders said. February and March finished limit down with February at 82.050 cents. Other months ended 1.950 to 0.300 cent lower. Weak fundamentals, including declining cash belly prices, rising slaughter levels and less-than-expected drawdown from storage, weighed on sentiment from the start and the decline took futures into chart sell points, traders said. Sell stops were touched off under 83.200 cents, basis February early, and again under 82.700 cents late which took nearbys limit down. Dean Witter was a notable seller on the setback with scattered fund and local pressure also cited, traders said. Futures turned technically weak despite ending strong Tuesday as fundamentals weakened. Cash belly prices fell another $2 to $4 per cwt with 14-16 lb bellies in the $80 to $83 area, the lowest since July 8. Tuesday's CME out-of-town storage data was called bearish, showing an out-movement of 0.247 million lbs--less than the trade expected, sources said.
