The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said on Thursday that AT&T Corp's spin off of Lucent Technologies Inc will be achieved with the issue of "when issued" stock in both companies at a date yet to be set. The companies will finally be split on September 30, although 17.6 percent of Lucent is already trading after an initial public offering in April. AT&T on Tuesday announced a regular $0.33 dividend payable to shareholders of record on September 12. Shareholders of record on September 17 will be entitled to a distribution of Lucent stock. AT&T when issued stock will be allocated the trading symbol T wd.N, an NYSE spokesman said. The stock is the new rump of AT&T which provides telecommunications services. It carries no right to a distribution of Lucent shares, and even if it is issued prior to September 12 it will carry no rights to the AT&T dividend. On September 30 the stock symbol will revert to. The when issued stock in Lucent LU wi.N carries no rights to Lucent dividend of $0.075 even if it start trading before the record date of 12 September. At September 30 it will revert to the stock symbol The use of when issued stock smooths a split up such as AT&T's and allows professional investors to trade Lucent or AT&T without owning the stock. AT&T said in September 1995 it would split up into three publicly traded companies -- a core telecommunications services company, a telecommunications equipment company, later named Lucent, and NCR Corp, a computing firm. NCR's spin off is due to take place by the end of the year. AT&T's 24-hour shareholder information line is 1-800-756-8500  -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610
