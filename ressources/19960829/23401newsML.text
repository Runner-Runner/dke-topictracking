Two German physicians have filed a civil action to close down a nuclear power plant, alleging it is responsible for a high number of cancer cases in the area, their lawyer said on Wednesday. "All indications show that the high rate of leukaemia in children in the immediate vicinity of the Kruemmel plant is caused by the plant," lawyer Wolfgang Baumann told Reuters. Doctors Hajo Dieckmann and Hans-Ulrich Clever are seeking to close down and withdraw the operating licence of the Kruemmel nuclear power plant in the coastal state of Schleswig-Holstein, charging radioactive emissions from the plant are directly responsible for the high local incidence of leukaemia. The Mainz children's cancer register shows that the incidence of leukaemia among children around Kruemmel is up to 70 times higher than in the rest of the country. But Hamburg Elektrizitaets-Werke, operators of the plant which has been running for over 25 years, remains convinced that there is no direct link between the plant and the high incidence of illness. Today's civil action is the lastest in a long string of legal suits attempting to close down the Kruemmel plant. Last week Germany's federal court in Berlin overturned a 1994 Schleswig administrative court decision keeping the plant running after an environmental group demanded it be shut because it was operating with unauthorised combustion elements. The federal court now demands the local court look into whether there is a link between the cancer rates and the plant. Baumann said the Diekmann and Clever action was even broader than that filed by the environmentalists. "We are seeking to shut the plant for good," Baumann said, adding that effectively there were now two legal actions progressing at the same time. However, Baumann said it would take a number of months before a decision is handed down in his case. "I don't expect to hear anything before the end of this year."
