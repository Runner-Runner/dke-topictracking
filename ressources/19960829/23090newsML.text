Australia's current account deficit for July was A$1.282 billion, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported. Economist's median forecasts had been for a deficit of A$1.3 billion. In June, the deficit was A$1.223 billion (revised from A$1.291 billion). The following is a selection of economists' immediate reactions to the data. BRUCE FREELAND, CHIEF ECONOMIST, COMMONWEALTH BANK:   "They are pretty much in line with expectations. Another A$1.3 billion deficit, pretty good news and basically I think about as good as Australia's current accout can be expected to be at the moment. I'm not to worried about the fall in exports, the imports there down mainly because the capital good imports were down. The big constraint remains the A$1.7 billion per month on our net income deficit. That's not going to change in a hurry, that really does put a floor under the current account."
