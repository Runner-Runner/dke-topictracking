The ringgit ended steady against the dollar after being kept in a tight range all day. Dealers said trading was largely quiet though some commercial orders to buy dollars were noted in the morning. "It looks like 2.4910 to 50/60 will hold for the next week unless we have some news," said a commercial bank dealer. The mixed trend of the major currencies was another factor in the quiet ringgit market, dealers said. At the 1000 GMT local close, ringgit was at 2.4936/46 per dollar against 2.4940/45 on Wednesday.   Dealers said the availability of ample funds in the money market indicated that the ringgit remains a favoured currency, especially after Malaysia recorded a second consecutive monthly trade surplus in June. In the money market, interbank rates dipped further in a consolidation after surging last week on Bank Negara's market intervention. The one-month rate was at 7.10/20 percent from 7.20 previously. -- Reme Ahmad (603-201 4813)
