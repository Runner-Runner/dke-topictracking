Australian bond yield spreads to other dollar bloc bonds narrowed in again against other dollar bloc bonds, despite local market prices being checked by overhead resistance, traders said.   The market is now close to the tight spread levels seen prior to the corrective sell-off earlier in the week. Supply factors continued to weigh on the U.S. and Canadian debt markets, and even though today's NZ$100 million government bond tender met a strong response, the market itself had a lifeless session, traders added. -- Colin Brinsden 61-2 9373-1800
