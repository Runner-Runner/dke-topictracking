Trading company Hagemeyer NV said on Thursday it planned to acquire Winterhalter & Fenner AG in Zurich. Winterhalter is a leading electrotechnical wholesaler in Switzerland, with branches in Zurich, St Gallen and Luzern, the Dutch company said in a statement. Hong Kong's First Pacific Co has a controlling stake in Hagemeyer.   Hagemeyer said Winterhalter had annual sales of over 100 million guilders, adding that the acquisition offered the opportunity to enter the Swiss market. "The acquisition will be internally financed and is expected to make an immediate positive contribution to Hagemeyer's earnings per share," the company said, giving no definitive financial details for the deal. The company earlier announced a jump in first half net profit to 111.3 million guilders from 70.7 million. First half earnings per share rose to 2.65 guilders from 2.36 guilders. -- Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000
