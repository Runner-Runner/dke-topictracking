Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has approved plans, frozen by the previous Labour government, to build more homes in existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank, his spokesman said on Thursday. The spokesman, Avi Benayahu, declined to say how many housing units would be built but Israeli media reports put the number at between 2,000 and 3,550.   The decision was certain to anger Palestinians, who observed a strike called by President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday to protest against the right-wing Israeli government's policies on settlements and Jerusalem. "The minister approved a number of construction plans in existing settlements. These are building plans which had been approved in the past by the (Labour) government and later frozen," Benayahu said in a statement. The Maariv newspaper said Israel would add 700 housing units to the settlement of Kiryat Sefer, 1,050 to Hashmonaim, 900 to a nearby Jewish seminary, 200 to Matityahu and 700 to Betar Ilit. All are in the West Bank, near the pre-1967 Middle East war border. Israel Radio put the number of new homes at 2,000. Benayahu said Mordechai's approval was in line with the decision by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel the previous administration's building freeze in the West Bank.
