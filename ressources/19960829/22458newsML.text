Iran expects to have its eighth oil refinery, located in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, ready for operation by March 1997, OPEC's official news agency (OPECNA) said on Thursday. The 232,000 barrels per day (bpd) plant will run on 220,000 bpd of heavy crude oil plus 12,000 bpd of gas condensate from the Sarakhs reservoir in the northeastern province of Khorasan, OPECNA cited Seyed Reza Kasaeizadeh, head of refining at the National Iranian Oil Products Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC) as saying. The Bandar Abbas refinery will produce fuel oil, liquid gas, jet fuel, gasoline, coal tar and sulphur. Kasaeizadeh put the total nominal capacity of refineries throughout the country at 1.2 billion bpd. He also said the production of oil products in the year to March 20, 1996 was worth $10 billion, three percent up from the previous year. Oil product imports declined to 1.7 million tonnes in the year to March 20, 1996. Kasaeizadeh said Iran was improving its self-sufficiency in oil products through the reconstruction of the Abadan refinery and by commissioning motor oil units at the Abadan and Isfahan plants. In the past five months, Iran has started exporting some of its oil products. Iran's annual revenues from the export of refined oil products should amount to $600-$800 million, he said. Petroleum officials said the hard currency earned would be invested in further developing the oil industry. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8145
