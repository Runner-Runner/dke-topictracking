Danish holding company Sophus Berendsen on Thursday published its first results since relinquishing its majority interest in Britain's Rentokil, declaring net profit up 15 percent. Berendsen reported a first half 1996 net result of 445 million crowns ($78 million) , up from 386 million in the same period last year and slightly above average analysts' forecasts of 431 million. Pre-tax profit was up to 640 million crowns from 566 million and despite the reduction of its holding in Rentokil to 37.5 percent from 51 percent as a result of Rentokil's takeover of British rival BET  Rentokil remained Berendsen's biggest asset, with a pre-tax contribution of 533 million crowns. Berendsen said that even excluding Rentokil earnings business went well in the first half and it expected continued improvement for the full year. "The pre-tax result without associated companies rose by 5.4 percent to 107.3 million crowns, despite a stagnant market and strong competition for some of the group's businesses," it said. But the stock market appeared unimpressed, sending the group's share down to a closing 692 crowns, from Wednesday's close of 720 crowns. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650 ($ = 5.702 Danish Crowns)
