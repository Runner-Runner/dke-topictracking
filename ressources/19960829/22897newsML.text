British components and engineering group T&N Plc said on Thursday that its trading outlook for the second half was mixed, after reporting an expected fall in its first half results to 58.1 million pounds. "We are continuing to take actions to ensure underlying margins are maintained even if volumes are less than buoyant," chairman Sir Colin Hope said in a statement accompanying the results.   Hope said the group, which is going through a phase of rationalisation, remained hopeful of progressing with its slow-moving effort to acquire the whole of German piston maker Kolbenschmidt, which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles. "Discussions with the German regulatory authorities are continuing and progress is expected before the end of the year," he added. The company announced no changes to its ongoing measures to provide for possible legal damages costs arising from its past asbestos manufacturing activities. Some share market observers had hoped for news of a new insurance plan in the results. T&N had flagged the profit fall, from 73.2 million pounds ($114 million) in the same year-ago period, in comments earlier in the spring. It held its interim dividend unchanged at 3.0 pence per share, a move that had also been expected by many share analysts. ($1=.6421 Pound)
