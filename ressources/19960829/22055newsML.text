Unilever's largest Indian subsidiary Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) on Wednesday reported a 37 percent rise in net sales at 22.07 billion rupees in the first half of calendar 1996. Profit before taxation at 2.38 billion rose by 36.7 percent while profit after tax, before extraordinary items, jumped by 40.1 percent to 1.48 billion rupees, it said in a statement. HLL reported extraordinary items of expenditure of 265 million rupees, which pulled down the net profit to 1.21 billion rupees. The extraordinary items comprise provision for leave encashment pertaining to prior years in tune with new accounting standards and compensation payment to Lakme Ltd and its subsidiary in respect of "non-compete" agreements signed recently. HLL recently signed a marketing joint venture with cosmetics maker Lakme. HLL said the results are not strictly comparable with previous years because of business restructuring between HLL and its subsidiary Hind Lever Chemicals Ltd (formerly Stepan Chemicals). Effective January 1, 1996, HLL's bulk chemicals and fertilisers business were hived off to Hind Lever Chemicals. HLL in turn took over the detergents business of Hind Lever Chemicals. "The underlying overall performance is better reflected in the consolidated figures of HLL and its subsidiaries," it said. "Consolidated net sales of HLL and its subsidiaries during the first half of 1996 grew by 28 percent to 24.54 billion rupees while profit before taxation at 2.61 billion rupees represents a 30 percent growth," it said. HLL board on Wednesday announced an interim dividend of 6.0 rupees per share against 5.0 rupees in the year ago period. -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000
