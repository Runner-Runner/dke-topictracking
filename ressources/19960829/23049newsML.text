Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Thursday that there was no reason why there should be a premium on Australian 10-year bonds compared with their U.S. equivalent in a low inflation environment. "If we can assure people that we have a low inflationary environment, then there's no reason why we should be paying premiums against the U.S. bond rate," he told reporters.   Costello had been asked about his forecasts about margins between Australian and U.S. bonds. "There's no reason why we should be paying premiums if we can have low inflation," Costello said. "Of course we're always a smaller economy and that will probably put in a premium because you've got the transactional cost where people have got to do different work in relation to the Australian economy and assess its risk," he said. "But we're not a sovereign risk as opposed to the U.S. It's only an informational thing," Costello said.   "I guess because we're a smaller economy there will always be a difference but there's no reason why there would be a premium based on inflation, no reason at all," Costello said. Costello said the margin of Australian bonds over U.S bonds was now about 1.2 percentage points compared with two or more over the last couple of years. "That's almost a halving," he said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800
