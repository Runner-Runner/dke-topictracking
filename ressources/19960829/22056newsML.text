U.S. energy company Enron Corp plans to resume work on its 2,450-megawatt power plant in India next month, a senior executive said on Thursday.   "We're looking to begin work next month. Absolutely. Absolutely," said Sanjay Bhatnagar, president of Dabhol Power Co, Enron's Indian subsidiary which is building the power plant in the western state of Maharashtra. He was speaking to Reuters on the margins of a conference in the Indian capital on foreign direct investment. Work on the Enron power project was halted a year ago when the newly elected state government demanded renegotiation of the contract. Enron and government officials later agreed new terms. - New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
