Shares in Hambros Plc rose on Thursday amid press speculation over a possible break-up bid for the bank after shareholder Regent Pacific criticised its performance. The shares were 2-1/2p higher at 269p by 0852 GMT after earlier rising to 280p, their highest intraday level in two years.   "We've seen them lagging behind," said one senior dealer. "The papers said that Hambros is worth a lot more in parts than as a whole, and if they don't get their act together someone might just take the opportunity to do that," he added. Break-up bid speculation was fuelled when Hong Kong-based fund manager Regent Pacific bought a three percent stake in the British merchant bank and then criticised its performance.   The Financial Times cited Jim Mellon, who owns 25 percent of Regent Pacific, describing Hambros as an undervalued and undermanaged enterprise. Mellon also described the group's share price performance over the last 10 years as "diabolical", according to the newspaper on Thursday. Traders said the fresh attacks on Hambros management had propelled the company back into the bid target spotlight. "Hambros is right up there again with the other bid favourites," one said. --Elaine Hardcastle, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4027
