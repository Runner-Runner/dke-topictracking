Hungary's state privatisation agency APV Rt said on Thursday that after several aborted attempts it had sold a Budapest downtown property hosting Royal Hotel and a cinema to the sole bidder, Korut 11 Kft. "APV declared the sale of the property complex of Royal hotel and Apollo movie as successful for one billion plus one forint," said APV General Director Istvan Kocsis at APV's weekly news conference. "The long-lasting selling process which has been repeated several times, may now be completed," he added. The buyer is owned by Israel's Diamantur. No more information was available about the buyer. APV has raised over 700 million forints ($4.6 million) from the sale of the property while the remaining part of the purchase price will go to Budapesti Film Rt, the company which manages the cinema. -- Emese Bartha, Budapest newsroom (36 1) 266 2410 ($ = 151.2 Hungarian Forints)
