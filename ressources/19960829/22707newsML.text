Shares on Thursday held most gains, still probing new highs since October 1995 despite overseas jitters as Nokia jumped after rallying on Wall Street and overseas demand in Rauma and Fiskars took metals ahead. The HEX index rose 0.51 percent to 2,147.09, a new calendar year-high, in fair volume totalling 337 million markka, much of it in Nokia and Raisio. "The trend is still positive. If we don't see a crash on Wall Street, the market could continue to rally," a broker said. He said sharp gains in smaller companies -- 12 new highs were booked -- indicated the mood was strong. Nokia closed up 2.60 markka 190.00, clearly above its early dealings in New York. One broker said Nokia was technically strong and could be headed for the 210.00 markka level. In intra-session trade, Nokia hit 191.00 markka, its highest since June 5. Raisio challenged its 339.00 markka year-high, hitting 337.00 markka in lively trade, and ended up 7.00 at 335.00. "There is continued strong demand for Raisio as we've heard only good news recently from the company," one broker said, referring to a cattle feed finding it unveiled last week.
