Britain would not join in any sanctions against India if New Delhi persisted in its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Thursday. "I don't see that as remotely relevant to the question that we are addressing," the visiting foreign minister told reporters when asked if Britain favoured punishing India for its opposition to the pact.   India last week blocked adoption of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) at talks in Geneva, citing a provision New Delhi said could permit nations supporting the accord to take eventual coercive measures against any country opposing it. "There is no way India can be forced to agree to a treaty it does not wish to support, nor is there any way any country can be forced. So that has not been contemplated," Rifkind told Reuters after a news conference. Rifkind, who met Indian Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral on Thursday morning and was set to see Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda later in the day, said Britain respected India's right to reach its own conclusion over the CTBT. "I believe that our bilateral relations with India will not be affected by whatever decision India might reach in these matters," Rifkind told the news conference.
