French Tobacco company Seita said Thursday it had started legal action in the United States against Salomon Bros. investment bank, seeking punitive damages as well as recovery of $30 million in losses on two derivative swap transactions in 1994. Seita accused Salomon of breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of contract, a Seita statement said. The statement said the lawsuit is based on Salomon's recommendation and sale to Seita in 1994 of two high-risk derivative swap transactions that resulted in losses to Seita of about $30 million. The losses were recorded in its 1994 accounts, it added.
