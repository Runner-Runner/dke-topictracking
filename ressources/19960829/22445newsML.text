Three quarters of all Luxembourg- domiciled assets are contained in funds promoted by Swiss, Germans and Belgians, data from a new Luxembourg fund directory shows. The Luxembourg Fund Encyclopaedia, published by the London-based fund consultancy Fitzrovia, shows promoters from a further 23 countries account for the remaining 25 percent of assets. There are 443 separate promoters of Luxembourg funds. The directory gives information on 3,407 of the total 3,411 active funds as of December 31, 1995. Ranked by market share in terms of assets the top 15 promoters are all of Swiss, German or Belgian origin. The volume also ranks fund promoters within their peer group by country of origin and calculates their market share of particular segments and the market overall. Deka, with 24.2 percent share of segment, has replaced Deutsche Bank, with a 20.3 percent share, as the largest Luxembourg fund promoter of German origin, with a further 32 German sponsors accounting for the remaining 55.5 percent share. Largest net sales across an entire fund range were achieved by Commerzbank ($8.72 billion). Others included Swiss Bank Corp ($1.89 billion), Deka ($1.74 billion), Nordbanken ($683 million) and Fidelity ($612 million). The figures are based on monitoring of individual fund accounts. Largest net redemptions across an enture fund range were experienced by Deutsche Bank ($2.64 billion), Union Bank of Switzerland (2.43 billion) and Banque Bruxelles Lambert ($1.54 billion). While just 1,266 equity-based funds account for 37 percent of fund numbers, they contain just 15 percent of total net assets, the directory shows. It also measures growth in the number of active collective investment schemes and subfunds and compartments within them. Comparing Luxembourg to other offshore jurisdictions in Europe, the directory shows it has $349.1 billion of total assets against $21.0 billion in Dublin, $18.0 billion in Jersey, $15.5 billion in Guernsey, and $1.5 billion in the Isle of Man. Luxembourg's total of 3,411 registered funds compares with Dublin's 612, Jersey's 384, Guernsey's 474 and just 66 in the Isle of Man. Fitzrovia is planning to publish similar fund directories for Dublin, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of man in coming months. -- Caroline Allen, London newsroom +44 171 542 6414
