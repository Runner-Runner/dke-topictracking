GEC-Alsthom said on Thursday it had won an order worth 26 million Ecus to supply a steam turbine generator and other equipment for extension of Finland's Vaskiluoto cogeneration plant. The plant, supplying electricity and heat to the city of Vaasa on the Gulf of Bothnia, will be fully operational at the end of 1998, said a statement from the group, a joint venture between Britain's General Electric Co Plc and France's Alcatel Alsthom. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
