CME live cattle futures closed mixed with nearbys up and October posting a new contract high on demand from the strong tone to cash cattle, traders said. October posted a new contract high of 71.975 cents per lb before closing 0.375 cent higher at 71.875 cents. Other months finished 0.150 cent higher to 0.125 lower. Feedlots held their ground despite the slow start to the week and declining beef prices and packers started to pay higher prices for fed cattle Thursday. Cash cattle prices rose $1 per cwt to $69 and rumors circulated that $70 may also have been paid during the day, traders said. "Packers want to have inventory around them based on the (low) numbers out there" in feedlots, said Jim Clarkson, analyst for A and A Inc. Fed cattle supplies are low following sharply reduced placements of cattle earlier in the year. Commercial buying and local as well as fund short covering combined to push October up to the new high, traders added. Dean Witter was a late buyer in October while Refco bought December. Prudential Securities, Merrill Lynch, R.J. O'Brien, Refco and Cargill Investor Services also bought during the session, pit sources said.   In live cattle options, there was scattered call selling on the rally early. Late, commercial buying of April 68 calls was noted. Volatility was steady to weak, pit sources added. Feeder cattle futures generally followed the lead of live cattle early but slipped late in thin activity on strength in corn futures. Concern over higher feed costs weighed on sentiment despite expectations of good interest for replacement feeders at feedyards, traders said. The latest CME Feeder Cattle Index provided little direction as it was unchanged at $63.22 per cwt and is expected to show little change in the next quote, they said. August expired at noon, off 0.125 cent on the day at 63.125 cents. Other months closed unchanged to 0.275 lower with October off most at 62.850 cents. --Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725
