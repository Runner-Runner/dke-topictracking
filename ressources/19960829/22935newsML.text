German luxury carmaker Audi AG said on Thursday its nominal market share of the German car market would likely fall in 1996 to about six percent from 1995's level of 6.3 percent. Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel said in an interview he expected 1996 to be "a strong year" in Germany but that 1995 had been "an even stronger year" in the domestic market due to the introduction of the popular A4 vehicle. Demel said Audi, a unit of Volkswagen AG , was pursuing a strong internationalisation strategy that would seek to maintain the current market share in Germany and expand its foreign presence. Audi's deliveries to customers outside of Europe in the last few years has always remained under 15 percent, a rate Demel said must be increased. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
