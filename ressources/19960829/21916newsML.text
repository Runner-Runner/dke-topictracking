German construction company Strabag AG, suffering under a sluggish economy plaguing the industry, reported on Thursday a 2.6 percent drop in first half operating performance. The group said its group operating performance in the first six months of this year stood at 2.62 billion marks ($1.77 billion) compared with 2.69 billion marks a year ago. But for the year as a whole, the group forecast an improvement in its operating performance to 6.25 billion marks from 6.1 billion marks. Earnings in the first half however were unsatisfactory, Strabag said, declining to give numbers and saying only that that some units had made considerable losses. At the same time incoming orders also dropped to 2.66 billion marks from 3.15 billion marks. Business was particularly sluggish in Germany where performance dropped 12 percent. An expected improvement in operating income for the whole year will however make only a small impact on the balance sheet, Strabag said. Since the accounting of many projects will not be included in year-end results, some profits will only be realised in 1997, Strabag said. In 1995 the comapny posted a net profit of 18 million marks compared with 56 million in the previous year. ($1=1.4770 Mark)
