BellSouth Corp said on Thursday it will appeal the Federal Communications Commission interconnection ruling and ask the court for an expedited hearing. The Aug. 8 interconnection order sets the terms and conditions for how local telephone companies will open their networks to competition as outlined in the Telecommunications Act.   "BellSouth has concluded that the FCC has gone far beyond the intent of Congress with this massive order, which displaces private negotiations and usurps the states' authority to bring competition to the local marketplace," said Walter Alford, BellSouth's general counsel. He said the FCC rules ignore local needs and conditions and set prices too low. "The prices at which BellSouth will be required to lease parts of its network are so low that competitors will be discouraged from building new telephone networks and the jobs Congress expected to be created will be lost," he said. On Wednesday, GTE Corp and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp said they also would appeal the interconnection ruling.
