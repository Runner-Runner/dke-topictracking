Syria's General Foreign Trade organisation for chemicals and foostuffs (GEZA) issued a new tender to buy 26,000 tonnes of white sugar and 26,000 tonnes of raws for October-November delivery, a geza spokesman said. He told Reuters the tender replaces one for import of the same quanities which was cancelled by Geza because price offers did not meet its conditions. The Geza spokesman said the final date to receive price offers was September 4 and replies would be made on September 5. Both the whites and raws should be delivered between October 10 and November 10 in two equal cargoes of 13,000 tonnes each, the official said.
