Australian life office National Mutual Holdings Ltd has called for a simplified consumer production and prudential supervision structure in the first submission by a major financial service group to the Wallis inquiry into the Australian financial system. "The changing environment and increasingly global nature of financial services means the regulatory structure is now out of line with the needs of consumers," managing director Geoff Tomlinson said in a statement.   National Mutual has recommended to the enquiry that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) become the single consumer protection regulator supported by a single finance industry complaints service. It also asked for a new single regulator for prudential supervision using the existing structures of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Insurance and Superannuation Commission(ISC), the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC) and the (ASC).   National Mutual's model would see the RBA remaining the arbiter of monetary policy while the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would retain responsibility for competition policy. In addition to the new regulatory structure, National Mutual recommended the lifting of restrictions in the Bank Shareholding Act and Insurance (Takeovers and Acquisitions) Act which include limits on individual shareholdings in Australian banks. National Mutual intends to demutualise later this year and then list with an expected market capitalisation of about A$2 billion.			 -- Melbourne Bureau 61-3 9286-1435
