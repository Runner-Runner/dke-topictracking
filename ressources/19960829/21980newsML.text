Tamil Tiger rebels overran an isolated police post in Sri Lanka's northeast early on Thursday, killing 24 policemen and five civilians, defence officials said. A large group of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) guerrillas first attacked a police patrol and then stormed the Kudapokuna police post just north of Welikanda, 200 km (125 miles) from Colombo, they said. The rebels killed 24 policemen and five civilians from a nearby village in the raid. Ten policemen and five civilians were wounded. A military spokesman said the rebels suffered heavy casualties when troops counter-attacked with artillery fire support, but he did not give figures. It was the second time in three days that the rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the Indian Ocean island's north and east, attacked police. On Tuesday, suspected Tamil Tigers hurled hand grenades at a police vehicle in a crowded market in the army-controlled northern town of Vavuniya, killing at least two policemen. More than a dozen people, including several policemen who were working undercover, were wounded in the attack. Vavuniya is just south of the northern mainland area controlled by the LTTE. The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the separatist war, now in its 14th year.
