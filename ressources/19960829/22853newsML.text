Austrian viscose fibres maker Lenzing AG said on Thursday first half results dived into the red and warned it would likely make further losses in the second half of this year as well. Lenzing said the group posted a pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings in the first half after a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period, and a net loss of 85.7 million compared with a profit of 117.8 million. "Losses in the second half will be roughly the same size," chief executive Heinrich Stepniczka told journalists at the company's earnings conference. In 1995, Lenzing posted a full-year group pre-tax profit of 312.6 million schillings, up 2.5 percent on 1994. The group attributed the poor first half to weak demand and falling prices of viscose fibres, as well as sluggish economies in the West. "A preview of the second half of 1996 does not reveal any signs of a significant improvement in market conditions," Lenzing said in a statement released ahead of the conference. The market took the news in its stride, with Lenzing stock initially slumping to a new year low before rebounding to stand 0.9 percent lower at 670 in an overall limp Vienna market. Traders said Lenzing's first half loss was in line with expecations. "But volume was very thin. I would expect a decline of a maximum three to four percent today," said one. Just 751 shares had changed hands after 45 minutes of trade. -- Julia Ferguson, Vienna newsroom, +431 53112 274
