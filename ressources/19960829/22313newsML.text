Optical Cable Corp said on Thursday it has requested securities authorities to investigate the short interest position -- a bet that the stock price will fall -- of 725,889 shares of its common stock. "This accounts for 27.1 percent of all registered shares outstanding in the float at the present time," chairman, president and chief executive officer Robert Kopstein said. Kopstein said in a telephone interview that a network of market makers and stockbrokers was allowing uncovered short positions in Optical Cable's stock.
