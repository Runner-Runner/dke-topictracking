China's fledgling Taikang Life Insurance Co Ltd sees its annual premium income at 4.0 billion yuan ($482 million) by the year 2000, or a five percent share of the industry total then, the China Daily said on Thursday. Taikang is aiming to open 10 to 15 branches in large cities over the next few years and increase its number of agents to 20,000 from the current 200, the newspaper quoted company chairman Chen Dongsheng as saying. The company will alter the traditional strategy for the Chinese insurance market by offering policies with higher premiums that have wider and more valuable guarantees, he said. Taikang also plans to adopt technology used by foreign insurers as well as foreign management techniques to bolster its market position, he said. Taikang, with registered capital of 600 million yuan, was one of five new insurance firms approved by the People's Bank of China last week. The newspaper gave no further details. Foreign insurers are keen to tap China's potentially huge market for life cover. A survey commissioned by insurance giant National Mutual Asia Ltd and issued on Tuesday said seven out of 10 urban Chinese householders are completely ignorant about life insurance. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)
