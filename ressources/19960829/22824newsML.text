The Irish Stock Exchange said on Thursday that Clondalkin Group Plc was in breach of stock exchange rules in a recent acquisition announcement. The Stock Exchange said a Clondalkin circular to shareholders on a proposed acquisition was issued without stock exchange approval and contained insufficient financial details.   "The Exchange...censures Clondalkin for the fact that it issued the circular without the Exchange's prior approval and omitted financial information required by the listing rules," the Stock Exchange said. The circular, on Clondalkin's acquisition of the Van der Windt Group, was issued on May 31. The Stock Exchange said Clondalkin had subsequently published the required information on June 14. The Stock Exchange said it regarded breaches of its listing rules as "a very serious matter". -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 676 9775
