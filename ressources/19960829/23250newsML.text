Australia wants to create a wool "pipeline" through China with stocks warehoused in Shanghai on the basis of zero tariffs for the import and export of wool and its products, trade Minister Tim Fischer said on Thursday. Fischer told a business meeting that it was hoped the arrangement, to be based in Shanghai's Pudong development zone, would help spur the export of Australian wool products to the United States and other markets. "This pipeline idea is on the basis of assurances of zero tariffs on wool from Australia through Pudong, value-added in Pudong and then zero tariff out," Fischer said. China at present levies tariffs on Australian wool imports used by its textile industry. Fischer gave no details of the pipeline scheme but an Australian trade representative said the idea of warehousing wool in Shanghai had been looked at two years ago and abandoned but had recently been revived.
