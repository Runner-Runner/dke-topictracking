UK property development company Slough Estates Plc said on Thursday increases in leases and better rental levels had led to improved results for the first half of the year. "The first point to make is we have seen a better underlying trend in our core portfolio," Slough Estates' executive chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs told Reuters in a telephone interview, adding this applied to both the number of leases and rental prices. Earlier Slough Estates said profit before tax for the first half of 1996 had risen by 4.6 million stg to 37.4 million stg, from 32.8 million stg for the same period in 1995.
