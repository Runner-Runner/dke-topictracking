American best-selling trend-watcher John Naisbitt says Europe's planned single currency project is doomed to fail, Finnish current affairs weekly Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Thursday. "Maastricht is dead, stone dead. It will never come about... A currency is part of national identity. That's why there won't be any single currency," Naisbitt was quoted as saying in an interview. The European single currency idea was as absurd as if a single currency were proposed for the United States, Canada and Mexico, he said. "Free trade yes, currency union no," said Naisbitt, the author of "Megatrends", "Global Paradox" and "Megatrends Asia".
