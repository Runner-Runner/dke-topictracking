Colombia's peso closed higher for the first time in five consecutive trading sessions as dollar- sales stemming from oil export revenues helped give the local currency a boost. Traders said the peso, which hit an intraday low of 1,045.80, closed at 1,041.50, up 2.7 pesos from Wednesday's close. About $20 million in oil earnings that came into the interbank market midday through the session were largely responsible for the peso's move upward, traders said. They said additional support came from dollar sales by cement companies. Dealers reported 314 million trades for a total of $139.7 million. -- Juan Guillermo Londono, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
