German Bund futures held on to small gains in late trade after being driven well off early highs by stronger than expected U.S. economic data. Bunds, as has been the case for several sessions now, continued to outperform other debt markets, both in Europe and in the U.S., with the mark showing strength. The September Bund DTB future was up six basis points at 97.39 in late trade, but down from the day's high of 97.54. "There is not a lot to focus on right now, so I would expect recent ranges to continue," said Catherine Lee, bond market analyst at R.H. Wrightson & Associates Inc.   Bunds continued to outpace U.S. debt with the spread to T-notes widening out to minus 58 basis points from minus 51 points early in the day. Analysts said the short-end of the yield curve continued to be helped by the strong mark and worries about French and Spanish budgets. Indications budgets in those countries will be wider than expected could trigger a flow into German securities. Analysts, however, said that with no economic indicators on the horizon until next week's U.S. jobs report, Bunds should remain in ranges between 97.54 and 97.15.   Analysts said the spread between Bunds and T-notes may continue to widen out further with little sign that German rates will be increased. But analysts said they see little chance for the contract to regain the 98.30 area seen just before the Bundesbank cut the repo rate to 3.00 percent last week. They said with rates at already low levels, a sharply stronger U.S. market is the primiary way Bunds could climb again, but that German debt will underperform Treasuries if they post solid gains. --Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525
