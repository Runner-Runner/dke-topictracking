The Australian Bureau of Statistics revised down its estimates of Australia's current account deficit for the three months to June by a total of A$224 million. The previous three months were not revised.   The current account deficit for the fiscal year to June is now estimated at A$20.298 billion, down from A$20.541 previously estimated. The bureau's trend estimates -- moving averages intended to remove volatility -- now show an improving current account deficit. Recent months' sharply volatile seasonally adjusted figures had created a slightly worsening trend picture in June. The trend estimates now show the current account deficit improving continuously since early 1995, except in April 1996, when it was barely changed.   In trend terms, the current account deficit was A$1.506 billion in July, down from A$1.578 billion in June. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2370
