Senior Israeli and PLO negotiators began talks on Thursday just hours after the end of a general strike in the West Bank and Gaza against Israel's policy towards the Palestinians. Former Israeli army chief Dan Shomron and Palestinian Local Government Minister Saeb Erekat, chairmen of a steering committee that oversees implementation of self-rule deals, convened in a Jerusalem hotel, witnesses said.   Earlier, Erekat told reporters the Palestinians had asked for the meeting. "We hope (it) will result in the immediate reciprocal implementation of the agreements signed," he said. Palestinians have been demanding Israel carry out its long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron, a partial pullout pledged by the former Labour government. Israel's new right-wing government is still studying a revised redeployment plan formulated by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai that is likely to leave more soldiers in Hebron, where 450 Jewish settlers live among more than 100,000 Palestinians. Erekat and Shomron began their talks a day after Palestinian President Yasser Arafat accused Israel of having declared war on Palestinians by expanding Jewish settlements and taking an uncompromising stand on the future of Jerusalem.
