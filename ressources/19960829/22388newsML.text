BIG Entertainment Inc said on Thursday its board of directors had adopted a shareholder rights plan. The company said in a statement the move was designed to "protect company stockholders in the event of takeover action that would deny them the full value of their investment."   Terms of the rights plan provide for a dividend distribution of one right for each share of common stock to holders of record on September 4. The rights will become exercisable only in the event an acquiring party accumulates 15 percent or more of the company's voting stock, or if a party announces an offer to acquire 30 percent or more. Holders of more than 15 percent of the voting stock as of March 16, 1996 - the date the board approved the rights plan in principle - generally will not trigger the rights unless and until they acquire an additional five percent of the voting stock. The rights will expire on September 4, 2006. Each right will entitle the holder to buy one share of common stock at a price of $25. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, holders of the right will be entitled to purchase either stock of the Company or shares in an "acquiring entity" at half of market value. 	  -- New York newsroom, (212) 859-1610
