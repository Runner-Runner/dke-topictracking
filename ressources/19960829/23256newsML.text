Private Chinatrust Commercial Bank said on Thursday it and 12 other Taiwan banks had agreed to offer a T$2 billion syndicated loan to Trace Technology, the island's only hard disk maker. The loan will enable Trace to start integrated production without outside assistance, Chinatrust said in a statement. It said Trace, one of the world's top 10 makers of hard disks, was expected to achieve a 1996 pretax profit of T$600 million. The loan will be in two currencies -- T$1.05 billion and US$35 million -- both to mature in five years, it said. The interest rate for the Taiwan dollar portion is the average prime rate of First Commercial Bank and Chinatrust Bank, plus 0.625 percentage point, it said. The rate for the U.S. dollar loan is LIBOR plus 0.85 percentage point. Chinatrust is the lead underwriter of the loan. Among the 12 banks joining the syndicate are China Development and International Commercial Bank of China. -- Taipei Newsroom (5080815)
