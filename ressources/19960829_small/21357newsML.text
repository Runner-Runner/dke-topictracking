NK LUKoil, Russia's biggest oil company, said its oil output in the first six months of this year was 1.15 million barrels per day, 0.8 percent higher than a year earlier. "The results of LUKoil's work in the first half of 1996 reflect a continuing trend towards stabilisation of the Company's production," it said in a statement.
