President Fidel Ramos on Thursday pledged to pump his government's entire available resources to develop the southern Philippines after a peace deal is signed with Moslem guerrillas. He said he was optimistic that government and rebel panels meeting in Jakarta would resolve remaining issues to clear the way for the signing in Manila on Monday of a final agreement ending a 24-year rebellion on Mindanao island and adjacent islands. "With peace installed, the government commits its total efforts and available resources to accelerate economic, social and human development in southern Philippines," he said in a statement. He said the signing of the accord would usher in "a new era of peace in Mindanao which has known mostly hostilities for the last 400 years". Mindanao, 800 km (500 miles) south of Manila, has been racked by violence since the 16th century when Spain colonised the Philippines and launched a campaign to Christianise the southern region, which the Moslems regard as their ancestral homeland. The Spanish colonial rulers failed to subjugate the Moslems. Fighting raged intermittently in the area after the United States ousted the Spanish colonial rulers towards the end of the 19th century, and continued after the Philippines won independence in 1946. More than 125,000 people have died in the current conflict which began in 1972. Negotiators for the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) met for their final round of talks in Jakarta on Thursday to agree on the text of a formal accord expected to be initialled in the Indonesian capital on Friday. "We face the final day of our long journey towards peace," government delegation chief Manuel Yan told the opening ceremony chaired by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. Indonesia heads an Islamic panel which is mediating the talks.
