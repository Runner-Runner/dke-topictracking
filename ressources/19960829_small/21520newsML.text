Utilicorp New Zealand said on Friday it would offer $8 a share for up to five percent of Power NZ under the terms of a restricted transfer notice. The offer is for up to 7,573,511 shares in Power NZ. Utilicorp said the notice was given in addition to, and without prejudice to its June 12, 1995 offer and would not affect that offer. It said the acquisition would be made on and from September 20, 1996 and remain open until October 25 unless extended by Utilicorp NZ.
