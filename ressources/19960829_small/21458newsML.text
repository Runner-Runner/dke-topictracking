Mexican Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said on Thursday that the country's financial markets were performing "reasonably" and he hoped the leftist rebel attacks that killed 13 people overnight would be seen in their "real context". Asked about the attacks by radio station Radio Red, Ortiz said: "I understand that the interior ministry is working on the case, but I repeat that in these recent days the markets are behaving reasonably. "I hope that these actions will be taken in the real context in which they are occurring." He did not say what that context was, although market analysts said on Thursday they thought the attacks by the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army were timed to embarrass President Ernesto Zedillo in the days leading up to his second State of the Nation address, scheduled for Sunday. The main stock market index was down 72.74 points, or 2.13 percent, at 3,338.1 points in afternoon trading and the peso closed four centavos weaker at 7.535/7.540 in key 48-hour contracts. -- Martin Langfield, Mexico City newsroom 525 7289558
