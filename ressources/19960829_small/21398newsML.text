- Caspian Securities on Thursday initated coverage of Disco S.A., one of Argentina's leading supermarket chains, with a buy rating at a price of $19.50, the firm's analysts in Buenos Aires said. - Caspian said it expects rising sales and efficiency gains to drive after tax earnings to a compound annual growth rate of 57 percent over the next three years. - Operating profits should reach 4.1 percent of sales in 1997, up from 3.1 percent during 1995, Caspian said. Furthermore, it said funds from the initial public offering, which allowed Disco to cancel 56% of its total debt as of December 1995, would lower financial expenses. - Caspian said Disco is attractively valued compared with its regional peers, with an estimated 1997 P/E of 12.3x, which is at a 15.3% discount to peers from Chile and Mexico. - Caspian's 12-month price target is $24 per share, representing a 23% return. -- Carmen Pignotti, Buenos Aires Newsroom 541 318-0657
