Preliminary estimates for Hungary's maize crop show a 17 percent increase to 5.41 million tonnes compared with last year's harvest of 4.6 million tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry official told Reuters. "The relatively hot and humid summer was beneficial, as it compensated for lack of pesticides," said Lajos Buzassy, Deputy State Secretary at the ministry. The planted area was 1.083 million hectares and the average yield per hectare is estimated to be around five tonnes. -- Budapest newsroom +36 1 266 2410
