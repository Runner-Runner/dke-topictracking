Chilean financial group Cruz Blanca SA said it has signed a $27 million deal with Bankers Trust  to provide funding to allow Cruz Blanca to fulfill its commitments until March next year. The loan will be backed by the sale and buy-back of shares in two Cruz Blanca divisions, said general manager Albert Cussen. The pact involves the sale of 50 percent of life insurance Cruz Blanca Seguros de Vida and 20 percent of real estate firm CB Inmobiliaria with a commitment by the company to buy these back before Cruz Blanca sells its insurance unit this year. Cruz Blanca expects to receive offers next month for its insurance and pension division which includes its investments in Argentina, Colombia and Peru, said Cussen. The company, which has been plagued by speculation over its financial position, will draw up a short list of potential buyers by mid November, he said. Funds from the sale will be used to pay debts, an extraordinary dividend and finally the capitalize Cruz Blanca's real estate, transport and infrastructure division. -- Margaret Orgill, Santiago newsroom, 562-699-5595x212
