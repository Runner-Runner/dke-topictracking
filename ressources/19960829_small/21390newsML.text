Czech preliminary real industrial output in July rose 16.3 percent, year-on-year, putting output 9.2 percent higher for the January-July period, the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Thursday.    INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT    JULY 96    JUNE 96   JULY 95  JAN-JULY 96   real pct chg yr/yr   +16.3	 +1.8	+7.2	+9.2  AVERAGE INDUST WAGES JULY 96    JUNE 96   JULY 95  JAN-JULY 96   nominal chg yr/yr    +19.6	+13.3	 n/a     +17.8 Note. The CSU said the growth in the tempo of industrial production in July was heavily influenced by three extra working days as compared with July 1995. In a note the bureau said the extra working days accounted for some 7.9 percentage points of the figure. Final July output/wage results are scheduled to be released on September 9. Wage results are taken from a survey of 210 firms with 100 or more employees. Production results also contain estimates from firms with up to 100 workers, as well as physical persons registered in the trades offices. -- Alan Crosby, Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003
