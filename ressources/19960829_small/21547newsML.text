China will not allow political differences with Taiwan to interfere with trade and investment, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told visiting Taiwanese business leaders on Thursday. "We maintain that political differences should not be allowed to affect and interfere with economic cooperation between the two sides," state radio quoted Jiang as saying. The economies of China and Taiwan were complementary, Jiang said, adding that the two sides should strengthen economic cooperation to benefit the entire Chinese race. "No matter what the circumstances, we will protect all the legitimate rights of Taiwanese investors," Jiang said. A delegation of nearly 80 Taiwanese business leaders and politicians arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile, 12-day visit. Taiwanese economic officials are visiting in a private capacity. Beijing has recently stepped up pressure on the island to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport. Last week, China unilaterally announced a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links. Kao Ching-yuan, the head of the Taiwanese delegation, on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taipei, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties.
