Prices on the Caracas Stock Exchange were seen slipping on Thursday as traders unwound positions on news late Wednesday that the privatization of Banco de Venezuela had been postponed indefinitely, traders said. "The tendency is definitely down," said Financorp broker Hector Perez. "The news comes on top of the fact that brokers were already beginning to take profits yesterday." The bolsa's 19-share index hit a third consecutive record high Wednesday, gaining 0.54 percent to close at 4,738.11 in active trade. -- Silene Ramirez, Caracas Newsroom 582 834405
