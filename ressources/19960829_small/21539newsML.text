The Grains Council of Australia (GCA) said the most appropriate capital base for the Australian Wheat Board (AWB), a statutory authority which is undergoing commercialisation, would be A$500 million to A$550 million. GCA president Jeff Arney said the figures had been agreed on unanimously by grain growers, as had views on AWB's structure. Growers were unanimous in their support for retention of the AWB's single export desk (its monopoly on exports of Australian wheat) and a high level of harvest payments, an issue with implications for AWB's capital base, Arney said in a statement.   GCA supported AWB continuing harvest payments of 80 percent of the annual estimated net pool return plus subsequent payments and other optional payment programmes, he said. "GCA state affiliates were unanimous that a harvest payment of at least 80 percent with subsequent payments was essential for the long-term sustainability of growers, the AWB and the industry," he said. A capital base of this magnitude would also give a restructured AWB the ability to offer a range of payment options to growers which could be tailored to suit alternative payment options if that is what growers and the AWB want, he said.   GCA's decision on the AWB capital base was taken after advice from from indepedndent financial consultants Bankers Trust, the GCA statement said. Australia's government has indicated it will remove the government guarantee on AWB borrowings by 1999, to place the AWB on a commercial footing. The required capital base would be reached before 1999, Arney said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
