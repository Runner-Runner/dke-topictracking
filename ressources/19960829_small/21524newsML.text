Some of the recent heat may be going out of world grain prices, lately at historic highs, although market signals on Thursday indicated a clearer direction could emerge after the coming U.S. long weekend. Chicago markets will be shut on Monday for the Labor Day holiday. WHEAT Grains fell sharply on Wednesday as professional speculators led by the funds took profits and quit the market before the holiday.   At the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans keyed a general selloff. Corn (maize) and wheat followed with the December wheat contract down nine cents at $4.55 per bushel. "End-of-the-month fund profit-taking," said analyst Steve Bruce of E.D. and F. Man International. However, Vic Lespinasse at Dean Witter Reynolds cited reports of improved harvests around the globe which may replenish world grain stocks that are at their lowest in 20 years. "There are bigger wheat crops coming in all over the world," he said.   Thursday saw prices steady and December wheat little changed and reluctant to go below $4.50 per bushel. But this compared with a historic high at $7.50 in March and values steadily above $5 for much of the time since then. CBOT what futures closed 4-1/4 cents per bushel higher to 1/2 lower, with September unchanged at $4.51-1/4. On the harvest front, Thursday brought fresh examples of better crops in various nations. Germany said its grain crop was likely to be 41 million tonnes after 39.9 million in 1995. Uzbekistan said its harvest was complete and predicted it would come in at 2.7 million tonnes after 2.38 million last   year. Easier prices on Thursday led the European Union to grant an export subsidy for the first time in 15 months on grain exports to former European colonies. OIL Crude oil prices rallied strongly on Thursday, on intensified concern about low stocks of heating oil and hurricanes sweeping across the Atlantic.   Brent crude oil futures for October delivery gained alost 50 cents to around $20.75 per barrel by 1700 GMT, just 20 cents below a four-month peak touched earlier in August, and 28 percent higher than this time last year. METALS Industrial metals were also generally firmer on the London Metal Exchange, led by flagship copper. Three months delivery copper broke above resistance at $1,950, ending the afternoon session $16 stronger at $1,959 per tonne after hitting a two-week high of $1,964.   But progress on the upside may be difficult as selling is expected from banks who are said to have taken over a long position that was held by Sumitomo Corp of Japan before it fired former star trader Yasuo Hamanaka in June. He was alleged to have run up losses of $1.8 billion on copper trades. Copper last touched $1,970 on August 1 and has since been trapped in a range with $1,900 as a floor. Traders were also watching for strike action due on Saturday at Chile's Salvador mine and an output stoppage at Gold Fields's copper smelter in Namibia.   Aluminium followed copper higher, cruising past $1,490 resistance on its way to confronting the $1,500 level, the day's high. Three month prices finished the afternoon at $1,497, a gain of $10.50. GOLD New York precious metals futures ended mostly lower for the third session Thursday, though little further activity is expected until after the U.S. holiday weekend. COMEX December gold ended down 60 cents at $392.40, after trading in a $393.20-391.70 range. In New York bullion trade, spot gold was quoted $387.60/388.00, from the London afternoon fix Thursday at   $388.00 and the close in New York Wednesday at $387.90/388.40.
