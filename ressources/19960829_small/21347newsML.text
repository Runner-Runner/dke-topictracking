Uzbekistan's 1996 grain harvest, completed last week, totalled 2.7 million tonnes according to preliminary figures, an official from the Central Asian nation's State Committee for Forecasts and Statistics said on Thursday. "The harvest is a little over 2.7 million tonnes," the official told Reuters. He said a final figure would be ready in November. Uzbekistan's 1995 harvest was 2.38 million tonnes.   The official gave no further details of the harvest. While up on last year's total, it falls far short of the government's 1996 target of 4.5 million tonnes. Uzbekistan had planned to become self sufficient in grain this year -- it needs about three and a half to four million tonnes of grain annually to feed its 23 million people. But grain traders and diplomats have said the target is unrealistic within the next few years. Official sources earlier this month said a dry autumn in 1995 and drought in some areas this year were the main causes for the lower than planned harvest. A total of 1.69 million hectares were sown with grains this year, but 490,000 hectares in this largely desert nation were not irrigated, official sources have said. Uzbekistan sowed 1.33 million hectares with grains in 1995. --Tashkent newsroom +3712 361 958
