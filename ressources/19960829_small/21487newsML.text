Argentine stocks were expected to drift lower Thursday in hestitant trading, pressured by a new setback in government plans to mend fiscal accounts, dealers said. "The market has virtually ground to a halt while it waits to see what happens with the tax package," said Eduardo Santamarina of brokers Santamarina Valores. The blue-chip MerVal index, after a one-day rally Tuesday, shed 0.9 percent Wednesday to 510.15 on news the lower house of Congress had decided to share revenue from new planned tax hikes on fuel with the provinces.   This move, unless revoked by the Senate, would allow the federal government to collect only about $500 million of the estimated yearly $1.5 billion in new fuel taxes. "It seems we're back to the old tug-of-war between (ruling) Peronist party legislators from the capital district and the provinces," said Santamarina. "However, this may all be resolved by IMF action." An IMF delegation is currently negotiating new fiscal goals with Argentina, which overshot first-half limits by $1.0 billion. Without the tax reform, the deficit could balloon to $6.6 billion in 1996, against the original $2.5 million goal.   "The IMF team has been keeping a low profile but behind the scenes it's really in control," said Santamarina, hinting an agreement on budget targets would somehow hinge on congressional approval of the tax reforms. In the meantime the bolsa was seen aimless. "It's dead money, a flat market," said private analyst Francisco Uriburu. "The only ones with significant positions are the banks and private pension funds. All other bidding has dried up." Uriburu saw underlying strength in food and oil sectors. -- Carmen Pignotti, Buenos Aires Newsroom 541 318-0657
