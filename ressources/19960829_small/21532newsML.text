Kiwi International Airlines chief executive Ewan Wilson said on Friday he expected the company to post a small profit at the end of the 1996/97 financial year. He told journalists at a briefing in Christchurch that Kiwi had been profitable until the end of March 1996, but would sustain losses until the end of September. However, Wilson said that by the end of this financial year Kiwi would be back in profitability, "albeit a very small profit".   In February this year Kiwi reported a NZ$1.2 million profit for its first 10 months of operation in 1995. --Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746
