Argentina's industrial output rose 3.4 percent in July from the same month in 1995, the Economy Ministry said Thursday. It added, however, that accumulated output in the first seven months of this year remained 0.2 percent below production in January through July 1995.   Output in July over June rose 8.7 percent when seasonally adjusted and fell 1.5 percent without adjustments. The largest gains recorded were textiles, up 53 percent from July 1995, synthetic fibres up 51 percent, automobiles 37 percent and beverages 36 percent. Cement, however, fell 58 percent from July 1995 and other construction materials was lower 40 percent.   In its survey of industrial producers, the statistics agency INDEC found that 36.4 percent expected demand to increase for their products in August, against 7.2 percent who expected demand to decrease. Also, 36 percent of those surveyed who do business outside Argentina said they expected their exports to climb in August. Six percent thought they would fall. Sixty-four percent forecast new investments in the current quarter, while 76 percent believe their current plant capacity is sufficient. Furthermore, 71 percent believe they will not need to change their credit needs, while 23 percent think they will have to take out new loans. -- Gary Regenstreif, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 541 318-0618
