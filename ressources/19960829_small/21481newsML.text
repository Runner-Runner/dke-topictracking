The Venezuelan government has only managed to sell about 10 billion bolivars worth of a 234-billion- bolivar treasury bill issue it started 15 days ago, a high- ranking government official said Thursday. "It is not an issue which has to be done straight away," said the official, who asked not to be named. The Central Bank has been offering direct placements of the bills, which have maturities of up to 180 days and yields of about 25 percent, since Aug 16. The issue was aimed at meeting current spending needs and draining excess liquidity, the official said. The official added that a planned issue of about 150 billion bolivar debt issue by state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) had been postponed for lack of investor interest. "Offers were made to five or six banks but they were not interested," the official said. The issue has been put off until late in the year, he added. -- Omar Lugo, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
