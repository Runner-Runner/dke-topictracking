Argentine bonds were unchanged on Thursday on a lack of market moving news and slow dealing ahead of the U.S. long weekend. "Nothing really happened today," said a trader at a large foreign bank. The 5.5 percent dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 ended flat at 114.80, while Argentina's FRB due 2005 was also unchanged at $77-5/8. Prices oscillated within narrow ranges through the session amid slight volumes, said traders.   No news emerged on the domestic political front adding anything to the concerns around whether or not the government's economic measures will be passed in full by Congress. Still, with sharp falls in U.S. Treasury prices this session pushing the yield on the 30-year U.S. benchmark bond to 7.04 percent, local players were encouraged by the fact that Argentine bonds held their ground. At the very least, stable Argentine bonds during falling U.S. markets is a sign that stronger sentiment may be returning to the market.   But with many U.S. players expected to take Friday off ahead of the Monday U.S. holiday, "Argentine bonds are likely to remain in narrow ranges," predicted the trader. Separately, Argentina's industrial output rose 3.4 percent in July from the same month a year earlier, said the Economy Ministry on Thursday. Industrial output in the first seven months of the year fell 0.2 percent from the same period in 1995. In the money markets, one day call money rates fell to 8.20 percent from 8.90 percent. -- Axel Bugge, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 54 1 3180668
