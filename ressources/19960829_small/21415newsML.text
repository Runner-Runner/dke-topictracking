Venezuela's economy is expected to shrink 1.1 percent in 1996 with growth returning by the end of the last quarter, government officials said. The non-oil economy is seen shrinking by 3.5 percent, while the oil sector is expected to post a vigorous 6.2 percent growth rate, Luis Carlos Palacios, coordinator of the presidential planning and economic commission told reporters. In 1995 the Venezuelan economy grew 2.2 percent as 6.0 percent growth in the oil sector boosted one percent growth in the non-oil sector. Palacios said overall economic growth in 1997 would reach four percent, as both oil and non-oil sectors registered four growth rates. Oil directly accounts for some 27 percent, and indirectly some 40 percent, of Venezuelan gross domestic product (GDP). -- Omar Lugo, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
