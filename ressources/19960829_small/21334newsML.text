The Bucharest stock exchange gained vigour on Thursday with overall turnover more than trebling from the previous 66.2 million lei and most prices picking up under strong demand. "We had 217.8 million lei in turnover today, thrice as much as previously, due to heavy trading in Azomures  AZOM.BX," one trader said. It was the first time in almost three months turnover jad exceeded 150 million lei. Fertiliser maker Azomures SA took 84 percent of turnover and traders attributed interest in its stock to healthy half-year results. Azomures recently said its six-month net profit more than doubled from the same period last year to 74.7 billion lei. "It was the sound profit which promises good dividends that prompted investors to buy heavily," another trader said. "We anticipated Azomures would cling to centre stage, but we did not expect it to perform so well." Prices of Azomures, like most of the bourse's 13 stocks, picked up due to strong demand. The fertiliser maker closed 2,200 lei stronger at 14,200. Investors also focused on Artrom SA engineering company, in which 5,110 of the 22,480 traded shares changed hands. Its price marked time at 2,600 lei. Brokers said the good turnover figure might also partly be a result of a recent 90 minute extension of continuous trading to 3-1/2 hours. "The recent move gives you more time to find clients to meet your orders," said a broker. The unofficial VAB Index -- a value-weighted index of all stocks computed by  Vanguard SA securities -- was 2.9 percent higher from the previous session, closing at 384.3 points. Its base was 1,000 points when it was created last November.
