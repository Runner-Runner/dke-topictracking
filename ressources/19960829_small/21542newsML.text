Office supplies retailer Corporate Express Australia Ltd said on Thursday that it expected earnings before interest, abnormals and tax for the first half ending August 31 to be lower than a year earlier. Corporate Express, previously known as Macquarie Office, cited costs associated with its growth since June 30 and the general economic slowdown as reasons for the lower earnings outlook. It did not give any specific earnings forecast nor its year-earlier profit but forecast sales of A$140 million for the half to August 31, compared with A$63.6 million a year earlier.   Corporate Express said the additional costs would taper off as the rationalisation of its acquisitions was completed, a process expected to substantially finished by February 1997, with substantial cost benefits starting to be realised by then. Corporate Express shares closed three cents lower at A$1.30 on turnover of 18,200 shares. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
