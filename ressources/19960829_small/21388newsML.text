Hungary's preliminary estimate for the 1996/97 sunflower crop was 893,000 tonnes, up from last year's harvest of 800,000 tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry official told Reuters. This represented an increase of 13 percent over average yield for the past five years, said Lajos Buzassy, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture. "Most of the spring planting was done under ideal conditions, and the crop is very good, except for some small, sandy fields," he added. The planted area was 483,000 hectares and the average yield per hectare is estimated at 1,850 kilos. -- Budapest newsroom +36 1 266 2410
