Deputies from Argentina's ruling Peronist Party denied Thursday they had undermined new tax measures by Economy Minister Roque Fernandez, promising the final bill would be identical to the original project.   The Chamber of Deputies' budget committee appeared to defy Fernandez Wednesday by dropping from his bill an article which would give the central government exclusive access to cash from new fuel taxes, rather than sharing it with provinces. But Jorge Matzkin, leader of the Peronist bloc in the lower house, told reporters: "The final reading of the text will be exactly the same as originally planned. What we are doing is dividing the sanction between the Senate and Deputies to advance more quickly."   Fernandez wanted all revenue from a new tax on diesel and new taxes on gasoline in his fiscal austerity package to go to shrinking a budget deficit he warns could reach $6.6 billion by year-end. At the moment 29 percent of gasoline tax is kept by central government, the rest being shared out. Economists reacted with alarm, saying the deputies' move could deprive the government of $800 million of badly needed tax revenue. But Matzkin said the committee merely decided to leave out of the text any "specific assignment" of fuel tax, leaving it to be included by the Senate where the Peronists have a clearer majority.   The Peronist congressman also clarified that the deputies' budget committee did not decide to clamp value-added tax on public entertainment, as was erroneously included in the final statement after Wednesday's committee hearing. "The political decision is to keep that area free of taxes as it is now," Matzkin said. -- Stephen Brown, Buenos Aires +541 318-0695
