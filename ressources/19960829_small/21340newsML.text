Hungary's state privatisation agency APV Rt said on Thursday it would not make any public comments about the timing of the second phase of the privatisation of oil and gas company MOL. "APV will decide later about the schedule of MOL's privatisation and we will give information about this in due time," APV General Director Istvan Kocsis told APV's weekly news conference. "It would definitely hurt our business interest if I told when we would like to do that," he added. "APV's experts will examine the context of the securities market in a complex way...and we will consider with the advisers when the right time arrives to place a share package," Kocsis said. Kocsis said APV's board had worked out the technical conditions necessary to continue MOL's privatisation. Investors are watching developments with increased interest after recent news. On August 15 MOL applied to the Budapest Stock Exchange for a delay in submitting its figures, saying it was preparing a full audit for the first half of 1996 ahead of the next phase of its privatisation later this year. But the bourse rejected the request and MOL is to publish its January-June figures on Friday. Last Thursday the government announced it had decided to postpone an energy price increase to January 1, 1997 from October 1, 1996, a step which MOL said would negatively influence its results this year. On the Budapest Stock Exchange MOL shares closed at 1,555 forints, up 15. -- Emese Bartha, Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
