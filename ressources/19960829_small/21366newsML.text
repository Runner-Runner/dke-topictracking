Russia's energy ministry called for a "partial limit" on exports of mazut fuel oil during the winter season during a cabinet meeting, Interfax news agency said on Thursday. It quoted first deputy energy minister Alexander Yevtushenko as calling for the limit to the exports but gave no direct quotation.   Yevtushenko later told a news conference that Russia could not ban mazut exports because of international agreements, but should set up an excise tax on sales abroad. "We cannot ban exports. We will only establish excises on mazut," he said. "We shall establish conditions so that it is profitable to sell mazut domestically and not abroad." Excise taxes -- effectively a form of sales tax -- usually apply both to exports and domestic sales, but it appeared that Yevtushenko was talking about exports only for the new tax. He told Reuters that preliminary ministry recommendations were for an export excise of about 14 ecus per tonne of mazut.   "It is only preliminary," he said, referring to the figure. "There are a lot of things that can change the situation." But he said the government had not yet made a final decision on when or whether to impose the tax. Interfax quoted him as saying Russia faced a shortage of three million tonnes of mazut, a major power station fuel in Russia, over the winter season which begins in one month.
