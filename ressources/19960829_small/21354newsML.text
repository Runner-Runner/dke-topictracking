The government is expected in coming months to outline in more detail plans for privatisation in Serbia, a senior official said on Thursday. "There is a silence now concerning privatisation in Serbia, but the government is about to outline its more concrete privatisation plans within two months," Radoje Djukic, minister for private enterprise said. But the minister called for caution because "it is a serious thing, it brings new philosophy and establishes new relations on the market." "We have to be very careful...we talk about $100 billion in socially-owned capital of companies that need to be transformed and privatised," said the first Serbian minister in the newly created private enterprise department. According to Djukic, the government seems to favour privatisation through capitalisation issues. "This means that companies would be enlarging their capital and they need additional capital to obtain fresh funds to kick-start production," he said. Djukic said his aim was to try to make the private sector an equal partner in the Serbian economy. This private enterprise ministry has suggested that Serbia establishes a privatisation ministry to supervise the process, said Djukic. "But when privatisation is over, that ministry should be abolished and ministries of industry and private enterprise integrated, to form a new ministry of economy," he said -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254
