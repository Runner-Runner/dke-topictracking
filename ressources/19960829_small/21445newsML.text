A proposed increase in Argentina's wealth tax is "very bad" news for the country's financial markets, Buenos Aires bolsa chief Julio Macchi said Thursday. "This is very bad for the bolsa. The rules of the game are constantly changing, and that's the worst thing that could happen to the capital markets," Macchi told Reuters. When the government decided to extend the wealth tax to stock and bond holdings amid the economic crisis last year, it promised the move would be temporary, he said.   Instead, the budget committee of the lower house of Congress on Wednesday approved for debate a proposed bill including an increase in wealth tax to 1.0 percent from 0.5 percent. Congress will debate the proposed rise in the tax, charged on assets of more than $100,000, during the next two weeks as part of a broader revenue-boosting package. "We believe that beyond the economic impact, (the tax) destroys the foundation of the capital markets because it punishes savings and investments and indirectly drives up the shameful unemployment rate of 17.1 percent," said Macchi.   "We are willing to debate until the end, to hold talks with and persuade legislators and governors, and to warn everyone not to take this step, because it will be very bad for each one of them and for everyone else," said Macchi A separate news release issued by the stock exchange Thursday said a wealth tax increase would discourage investment by foreign funds and trigger a flight of savings from the country. "It's necessary to stress that investment in companies of emerging countries is very volatile in the international markets, and those firms may be left without financing when foreign expectations are modified," the statement said. -- Patrick Adam, Buenos Aires newsroom, 54 1 318-0654
