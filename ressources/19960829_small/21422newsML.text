The Venezuelan bolivar closed flat at 474.50/475.50 per dollar Thursday, the fourth straight session unchanged in slow trading, dealers said. "The market was fairly quiet....As there as not too much demand the Central Bank did not have to supply many dollars," one trader said. Traders said the market had not been affected by Wednesday's surprise cancellation of the planned Banco de Venezuela privatization. -- Silene Ramirez, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
