Brazil's government has been given a green light for the privatization of mining conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) following the sacrifice by a senator of his own bill which sought to block the sale. Sen. Jose Eduardo Dutra of the left-wing Workers Party surprised the Senate on Wednesday afternoon by withdrawing his proposal that the CVRD selloff be subject to congressional approval. "I did it because my bill had become the subject of blatant horse-trading of which I want no part," Dutra said.
