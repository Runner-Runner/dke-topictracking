Hungary's state privatisation agency is to announce a one-round private tender for the sale of a 89.23 percent stake in Magyar Hitel Bank Rt, APV General Director Istvan Kocsis said on Thursday. "In harmony with the government's decision APV's board will announce a private privatisation tender for the sale of 89.23 percent of Hitel Bank," he told APV's weekly news conference. Participants will have 45 days to submit their bids, Kocsis said, declining to release the names and the number of invited bidders. "This refers to APV's business interest so we don't wish to publish either the names of those invited privately or their number," Kocsis said. However, MTI news agency quoting APV sources said on Wednesday that APV will invite three bidders. MHB, Hungary's fifth largest bank by assets, has a registered capital of 7.15 billion forints ($47.3 million). -- Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040 ($ = 151.3 Hungarian Forints)
