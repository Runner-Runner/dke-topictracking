Colombia's crude oil exports rose 7.5 percent during the first half of 1996 over the same period last year, the state oil company Ecopetrol said. It said Colombia exported an average of 329,000 barrels of crude oil per day (bpd) the first six months of the year, up from 306,000 bpd in January-June 1995. Prices for light Cusiana crude during the six-month period averaged $20.73 per barrel while the country's heavier Cano Limon oil sold for an average of $19.24 per barrel, Ecopetrol said. It said production during the first six months of the year averaged 613,000 barrels a day but gave no comparative figure for the same period last year. -- Juan Guillermo Londono, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
