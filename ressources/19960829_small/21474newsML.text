Mexican business leaders said on Thursday that surprise guerrilla violence in two Mexican states could scare off foreign investment and called for a stern response from the government. "With a belligerent group like this that uses high-powered weapons, you can't fight them with holy water," Carlos Abascal, president of the employers association known as Copermex, told radio station Radio Red. Mexico's stock market index plummeted, the peso lost ground against the dollar and interest rates were higher on the secondary money market following the overnight attacks. At least 13 people were killed when masked rebels launched seemingly coordinated attacks on several police and army posts in Guerrero and Oaxaca states. Hector Larios, president of the Business Coordinating Council (CCE), told Radio Red the violence could "inhibit investment in the country." The attacks are believed to be the work of the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), an armed group that first appeared two months ago, pledging a class war to bring down the Mexican government. Mexican markets had shrugged off the group as long as there were no major outbreaks of violence. --Dan Trotta, Mexico City newsroom, (525) 728-9507
